LangSmith Deployment supports deploying a [LangGraph](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) _graph_. However, the implementation of a _node_ of a graph can contain arbitrary Python code. This means any framework can be implemented within a node and deployed on LangSmith Deployment. This lets you keep your core application logic outside LangGraph while still using LangSmith for [deployment](/langsmith/deployments), scaling, and [observability](/langsmith/observability).
