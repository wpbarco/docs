LangChain provides a powerful prebuilt user interface that work seamlessly with agents created using [`create_agent`](/oss/python/langchain/agents). This UI is designed to provide rich, interactive experiences for your agents with minimal setup, whether you're running locally or in a deployed context (such as [LangSmith](/langsmith/)).

## Agent Chat UI

[Agent Chat UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/agent-chat-ui) is a Next.js application that provides a conversational interface for interacting with any LangChain agent. It supports real-time chat, tool visualization, and advanced features like time-travel debugging and state forking.

Agent Chat UI is open source and can be adapted to your application needs.
