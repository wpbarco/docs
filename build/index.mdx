# Documentation

LangChain is the platform for agent engineering. AI teams at Replit, Clay, Rippling, Cloudflare, Workday, and more trust LangChain's products to engineer reliable agents.

Our **open source frameworks** help you build agents:

- [**LangChain**](/oss/python/langchain/overview) helps you quickly get started building agents, with any model provider of your choice.
- [**LangGraph**](/oss/python/langgraph/overview) allows you to control every step of your custom agent with low-level orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop support. You can manage long-running tasks with durable execution.

[**LangSmith**](/langsmith/home) is a platform that helps AI teams use live production data for continuous testing and improvement. LangSmith provides:

- **Observability** to see exactly how your agent thinks and acts with detailed tracing and aggregate trend metrics.
- **Evaluation** to test and score agent behavior on production data and offline datasets for continuous improvement.
- **Deployment** to ship your agent in one click, using scalable infrastructure built for long-running tasks.
