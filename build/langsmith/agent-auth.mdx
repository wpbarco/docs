title: Set up Agent Auth (Beta)
description: Enable secure access from agents to any system using OAuth 2.0 credentials with Agent Auth.
---

<Note>Agent Auth is in **Beta** and under active development. To provide feedback or use this feature, reach out to the [LangChain team](https://forum.langchain.com/c/help/langsmith/).</Note>

## Installation

Install the Agent Auth client library from PyPI:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install langchain-auth
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain-auth
```
</CodeGroup>


## Quickstart

### 1. Initialize the client

```python
from langchain_auth import Client

client = Client(api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")
```

### 2. Set up OAuth providers

Before agents can authenticate, you need to configure an OAuth provider using the following process:

1. Select a unique identifier for your OAuth provider to use in LangChain's platform (e.g., "github-local-dev", "google-workspace-prod").

2. Go to your OAuth provider's developer console and create a new OAuth application.

3. Set LangChain's API as an available callback URL using this structure:
   ```
   https://api.host.langchain.com/v2/auth/callback/{provider_id}
   ```
   For example, if your provider_id is "github-local-dev", use:
   ```
   https://api.host.langchain.com/v2/auth/callback/github-local-dev
   ```

4. Use `client.create_oauth_provider()` with the credentials from your OAuth app:

```python
new_provider = await client.create_oauth_provider(
    provider_id="{provider_id}", # Provide any unique ID. Not formally tied to the provider.
    name="{provider_display_name}", # Provide any display name
    client_id="{your_client_id}",
    client_secret="{your_client_secret}",
    auth_url="{auth_url_of_your_provider}",
    token_url="{token_url_of_your_provider}",
)
```

### 3. Authenticate from an agent

The client `authenticate()` API is used to get OAuth tokens from pre-configured providers. On the first call, it takes the caller through an OAuth 2.0 auth flow.

#### In LangGraph context

By default, tokens are scoped to the calling agent using the Assistant ID parameter.

```python
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="{provider_id}",
    scopes=["scopeA"],
    user_id="your_user_id" # Any unique identifier to scope this token to the human caller
)

# Or if you'd like a token that can be used by any agent, set agent_scoped=False
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="{provider_id}",
    scopes=["scopeA"],
    user_id="your_user_id",
    agent_scoped=False
)
```

During execution, if authentication is required, the SDK will throw an [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/add-human-in-the-loop/#pause-using-interrupt). The agent execution pauses and presents the OAuth URL to the user:

After the user completes OAuth authentication and we receive the callback from the provider, they will see the auth success page.

The agent then resumes execution from the point it left off at, and the token can be used for any API calls. We store and refresh OAuth tokens so that future uses of the service by either the user or agent do not require an OAuth flow.

```python
token = auth_result.token
```

#### Outside LangGraph context

Provide the `auth_url` to the user for out-of-band OAuth flows.


```python
# Default: user-scoped token (works for any agent under this user)
auth_result = await client.authenticate(
    provider="{provider_id}",
    scopes=["scopeA"],
    user_id="your_user_id"
)

if auth_result.needs_auth:
    print(f"Complete OAuth at: {auth_result.auth_url}")
    # Wait for completion
    completed_auth = await client.wait_for_completion(auth_result.auth_id)
    token = completed_auth.token
else:
    token = auth_result.token
```
