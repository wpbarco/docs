When running the self-hosted [LangSmith with deployment](/langsmith/deploy-self-hosted-full-platform), your installation includes several key components. Together these tools and services provide a complete solution for building, deploying, and managing graphs (including agentic applications) in your own infrastructure:

        B <--> D[Studio]
        B <--> E[SDKs]
        B <--> F[RemoteGraph]
    end
```

- [LangGraph Server](/langsmith/langgraph-server): Defines an opinionated API and runtime for deploying graphs and agents. Handles execution, state management, and persistence so you can focus on building logic rather than server infrastructure.
- [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli): A command-line interface to build, package, and interact with graphs locally and prepare them for deployment.
- [Studio](/langsmith/studio): A specialized IDE for visualization, interaction, and debugging. Connects to a local LangGraph Server for developing and testing your graph.
- [Python/JS SDK](/langsmith/sdk): The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed graphs and agents from your applications.
- [RemoteGraph](/langsmith/use-remote-graph): Allows you to interact with a deployed graph as though it were running locally.
- [Control Plane](/langsmith/control-plane): The UI and APIs for creating, updating, and managing LangGraph Server deployments.
- [Data plane](/langsmith/data-plane): The runtime layer that executes your graphs, including LangGraph Servers, their backing services (PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.), and the listener that reconciles state from the control plane.
