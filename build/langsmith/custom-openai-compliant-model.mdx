The LangSmith playground allows you to use any model that is compliant with the OpenAI API. You can utilize your model by setting the Proxy Provider for  in the playground.

## Deploy an OpenAI compliant model

Many providers offer OpenAI compliant models or proxy services. Some examples of this include:

* [LiteLLM Proxy](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-proxy---cli)
* [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

You can use these providers to deploy your model and get an API endpoint that is compliant with the OpenAI API.

Take a look at the full [specification](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) for more information.

## Use the model in the LangSmith Playground

Once you have deployed a model server, you can use it in the LangSmith [Playground](/langsmith/prompt-engineering-concepts#prompt-playground).

To access the **Prompt Settings** menu:

1. Under the **Prompts** heading select the gear <Icon icon="gear" iconType="solid" /> icon next to the model name.
1. In the **Model Configuration** tab, select the model to edit in the dropdown.
1. For the **Provider** dropdown, select **OpenAI Compatible Endpoint**.
1. Add your OpenAI Compatible Endpoint to the **Base URL** input.

    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
    <img
        className="block dark:hidden"
        src="/langsmith/images/openai-compatible-endpoint.png"
        alt="Model Configuration window in the LangSmith UI with a model selected and the Provider dropdown with OpenAI Compatible Endpoint selected."
    />

    <img
        className="hidden dark:block"
        src="/langsmith/images/openai-compatible-endpoint-dark.png"
        alt="Model Configuration window in the LangSmith UI with a model selected and the Provider dropdown with OpenAI Compatible Endpoint selected."
    />
    </div>

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the model's response in the playground. You can also use this functionality to invoke downstream pipelines as well.

For information on how to store your model configuration , refer to [Configure prompt settings](/langsmith/managing-model-configurations).
