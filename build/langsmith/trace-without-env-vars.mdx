As mentioned in other guides, the following environment variables allow you to configure tracing enabled, the api endpoint, the api key, and the tracing project:

* `LANGSMITH_TRACING`
* `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`
* `LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT`
* `LANGSMITH_PROJECT`

If you need to trace runs with a custom configuration, are working in an environment that doesnâ€™t support typical environment variables (such as Cloudflare Workers), or would simply prefer not to rely on environment variables, LangSmith allows you to configure tracing programmatically.

<Warning>
Due to a number of asks for finer-grained control of tracing using the `trace` context manager, **we changed the behavior** of `with trace` to honor the `LANGSMITH_TRACING` environment variable in version **0.1.95** of the Python SDK. You can find more details in the [release notes](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langsmith-sdk/releases/tag/v0.1.95). The recommended way to disable/enable tracing without setting environment variables is to use the `with tracing_context` context manager, as shown in the example below.
</Warning>

- Python: The recommended way to do this in Python is to use the `tracing_context` context manager. This works for both code annotated with `traceable` and code within the `trace` context manager.
- TypeScript: You can pass in both the client and the `tracingEnabled` flag to the `traceable` decorator.

```python Python
import openai
from langsmith import Client, tracing_context, traceable
from langsmith.wrappers import wrap_openai

langsmith_client = Client(
  api_key="YOUR_LANGSMITH_API_KEY",  # This can be retrieved from a secrets manager
  api_url="https://api.smith.langchain.com",  # Update appropriately for self-hosted installations or the EU region
  workspace_id="YOUR_WORKSPACE_ID", # Must be specified for API keys scoped to multiple workspaces
)

client = wrap_openai(openai.Client())

@traceable(run_type="tool", name="Retrieve Context")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
  return "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict."

@traceable
def chat_pipeline(question: str):
  context = my_tool(question)
  messages = [
      { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user's request only based on the given context." },
      { "role": "user", "content": f"Question: {question}\nContext: {context}"}
  ]
  chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
      model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages
  )
  return chat_completion.choices[0].message.content

# Can set to False to disable tracing here without changing code structure
with tracing_context(enabled=True):
  # Use langsmith_extra to pass in a custom client
  chat_pipeline("Can you summarize this morning's meetings?", langsmith_extra={"client": langsmith_client})
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Client } from "langsmith";
import { traceable } from "langsmith/traceable";
import { wrapOpenAI } from "langsmith/wrappers";
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const client = new Client({
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",  // This can be retrieved from a secrets manager
    apiUrl: "https://api.smith.langchain.com",  // Update appropriately for self-hosted installations or the EU region
});

const openai = wrapOpenAI(new OpenAI());

const tool = traceable((question: string) => {
    return "During this morning's meeting, we solved all world conflict.";
}, { name: "Retrieve Context", runType: "tool" });

const pipeline = traceable(
    async (question: string) => {
        const context = await tool(question);

        const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
            model: "gpt-4o-mini",
            messages: [
                { role: "system" as const, content: "You are a helpful assistant. Please respond to the user's request only based on the given context." },
                { role: "user" as const, content: `Question: ${question}\nContext: ${context}`}
            ]
        });

        return completion.choices[0].message.content;
    },
    { name: "Chat", client, tracingEnabled: true }
);

await pipeline("Can you summarize this morning's meetings?");
```
