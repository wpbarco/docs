<Warning>
**Sharing a trace publicly will make it accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure you're not sharing sensitive information.**

If your self-hosted or hybrid LangSmith deployment is within a VPC, then the public link is accessible only to members authenticated within your VPC. For enhanced security, we recommend configuring your instance with a private URL accessible only to users with access to your network.
</Warning>

To share a trace publicly, simply click on the **Share** button in the upper right hand side of any trace view.

This will open a dialog where you can copy the link to the trace.

Shared traces will be accessible to anyone with the link, even if they don't have a LangSmith account. They will be able to view the trace, but not edit it.

To "unshare" a trace, either:

1. Click on **Unshare** by clicking on **Public** in the upper right hand corner of any publicly shared trace, then **Unshare** in the dialog.

2. Navigate to your organization's list of publicly shared traces, by clicking on **Settings** -> **Shared URLs**, then click on **Unshare** next to the trace you want to unshare.
