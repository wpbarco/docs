**Start here if you're building or operating agent applications.** This section is about deploying **your application**. If you need to set up LangSmith infrastructure, the [Hosting section](/langsmith/hosting) covers infrastructure options (Cloud, Hybrid, Self-hosted) and setup guides for Hybrid and Self-hosted deployments.
</Callout>

This section covers how to package, build, and deploy your _agents_ and applications as [LangGraph Servers](/langsmith/langgraph-server).

A typical deployment workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **[Test locally](/langsmith/local-server)**: Run your application on a local server.
2. **[Choose hosting](/langsmith/hosting)**: Select Cloud, Hybrid, or Self-hosted.
3. **Deploy your app**: Push code or build images to your chosen environment.
4. **[Monitor & manage](/langsmith/observability)**: Track traces, alerts, and dashboards.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Before deploying applications, you need a LangSmith instance to deploy to. Choose a [hosting option](/langsmith/hosting) first:
- [**Cloud**](/langsmith/cloud): Fully managed with automated CI/CD from a Git repository.
- [**Hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid): Enterprise option for data residency requirements.
- [**Self-hosted**](/langsmith/self-hosted): Full control and data isolation.
</Info>

## What you'll learn

- Configure your [app for deployment](/langsmith/application-structure) (dependencies, [project setup](/langsmith/setup-app-requirements-txt), and [monorepo support](/langsmith/monorepo-support)).
- Build, deploy, and update [LangGraph Servers](/langsmith/langgraph-server).
- Secure your deployments with [authentication and access control](/langsmith/auth).
- Customize your server runtime ([lifespan hooks](/langsmith/custom-lifespan), [middleware](/langsmith/custom-middleware), and [routes](/langsmith/custom-routes)).
- Debug, observe, and troubleshoot deployed agents using the [Studio UI](/langsmith/studio).
