This is a quickstart guide for deploying your first application to LangSmith Cloud.

<Tip>
For a comprehensive Cloud deployment guide with all configuration options, refer to the [Cloud deployment setup guide](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud).
</Tip>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

## 1. Create a repository on GitHub

To deploy an application to **LangSmith**, your application code must reside in a GitHub repository. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, use the [`new-langgraph-project` template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/react-agent) for your application:

1. Go to the [`new-langgraph-project` repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraph-project) or [`new-langgraphjs-project` template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/new-langgraphjs-project).
2. Click the `Fork` button in the top right corner to fork the repository to your GitHub account.
3. Click **Create fork**.

## 2. Deploy to LangSmith

1. Log in to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/).
2. In the left sidebar, select **Deployments**.
3. Click the **+ New Deployment** button. A pane will open where you can fill in the required fields.
4. If you are a first time user or adding a private repository that has not been previously connected, click the **Import from GitHub** button and follow the instructions to connect your GitHub account.
5. Select your New LangGraph Project repository.
6. Click **Submit** to deploy.
  This may take about 15 minutes to complete. You can check the status in the **Deployment details** view.

## 3. Test your application in Studio

Once your application is deployed:

1. Select the deployment you just created to view more details.
2. Click the **Studio** button in the top right corner. [Studio](/langsmith/studio) will open to display your graph.

## 4. Get the API URL for your deployment

1. In the **Deployment details** view, click the **API URL** to copy it to your clipboard.
2. Click the `URL` to copy it to the clipboard.

## 5. Test the API

You can now test the API:

    <Tab title="Python SDK (Async)">
    1. Install the LangGraph Python SDK:
      ```shell
      pip install langgraph-sdk
      ```
    2. Send a message to the assistant (threadless run):
      ```python
      from langgraph_sdk import get_client

      client = get_client(url="your-deployment-url", api_key="your-langsmith-api-key")

      async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
          None,  # Threadless run
          "agent", # Name of assistant. Defined in langgraph.json.

## Next steps

You've successfully deployed your application to LangSmith Cloud. Here are some next steps:

- **Explore Studio**: Use [Studio](/langsmith/studio) to visualize and debug your graph interactively.
- **Monitor your app**: Set up [observability](/langsmith/observability) with traces, dashboards, and alerts.
- **Learn more about Cloud**: See the [complete Cloud setup guide](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud) for all configuration options.
