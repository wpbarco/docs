This guide shows how to customize the OpenAPI security schema for your LangSmith API documentation. A well-documented security schema helps API consumers understand how to authenticate with your API and even enables automatic client generation. See the [Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide](/langsmith/auth) for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.

<Note>
**Implementation vs Documentation**
This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).
</Note>

This guide applies to all LangSmith deployments (Cloud and self-hosted). It does not apply to usage of the LangGraph open source library if you are not using LangSmith.

## Default Schema

The default security scheme varies by deployment type:

    <Tab title="LangSmith">
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

By default, LangSmith requires a LangSmith API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-api-key
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []
```

When using one of the LangGraph SDK's, this can be inferred from environment variables.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

By default, self-hosted deployments have no security scheme. This means they are to be deployed only on a secured network or with authentication. To add custom authentication, see [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).

## Custom Security Schema

To customize the security schema in your OpenAPI documentation, add an `openapi` field to your `auth` configuration in `langgraph.json`. Remember that this only updates the API documentation - you must also implement the corresponding authentication logic as shown in [How to add custom authentication](/langsmith/custom-auth).

Note that LangSmith does not provide authentication endpoints - you'll need to handle user authentication in your client application and pass the resulting credentials to the LangGraph API.

              "name": "X-API-Key"
            }
          },
          "security": [
            {"apiKeyAuth": []}
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing

After updating your configuration:

1. Deploy your application
2. Visit `/docs` to see the updated OpenAPI documentation
3. Try out the endpoints using credentials from your authentication server (make sure you've implemented the authentication logic first)
