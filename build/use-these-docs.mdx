title: Use docs programmatically
description: Connect LangChain documentation to your AI tools and workflows
---

We want to make our documentation as accessible as possible. We've included several ways for you to use these docs programmatically through AI assistants, code editors, and direct integrations, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Quick access options

On any page in our documentation, you'll find a contextual menu dropdown in the top right corner (look for the "copy page" button, and use the down arrow).

This menu gives you several options for working with our docs:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Copy" icon="copy">
        Copy the current page as Markdown text to your clipboard
    </Card>
    <Card title="View as Markdown" icon="eye">
        View the raw Markdown source of the current page
    </Card>
    <Card title="llms.txt" icon="file-lines">
        Access our machine-readable documentation format designed for LLMs
    </Card>
    <Card title="ChatGPT" icon="comment">
        Connect to ChatGPT for assisted reading
    </Card>
    <Card title="Claude" icon="message-bot">
        Connect to Claude Desktop for assisted reading
    </Card>
    <Card title="MCP Server" icon="plug">
        Connect via Model Context Protocol (our recommended option!)
    </Card>
    <Card title="Cursor" icon="code">
        Integrate with Cursor IDE
    </Card>
    <Card title="VS Code" icon="code">
        Integrate with Visual Studio Code
    </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Use our MCP server

Our documentation includes a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets AI applications query the latest docs in real-time.

### How to connect

Our MCP server is available at: `https://docs.langchain.com/mcp`

#### Connect with Claude Code

If you're using Claude Code, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http "docs-langchain" https://docs.langchain.com/mcp
```

#### Connect with Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Connectors
3. Add our MCP server URL: `https://docs.langchain.com/mcp`

#### Connect with Cursor or VS Code

Add the following to your MCP settings configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-langchain": {
      "url": "https://docs.langchain.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### What you can do

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions about LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith, and it will search our documentation to provide accurate, current answers.
