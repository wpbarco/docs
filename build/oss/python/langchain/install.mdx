To install the core LangChain package

LangChain provides integrations to hundreds of LLMs and thousands of other integrations. To avoid package bloat, these live in independent provider packages.

Common packages:

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    # Installing the OpenAI integration
    pip install -U langchain-openai
    # Installing the Anthropic integration
    pip install -U langchain-anthropic
    ```
    ```bash uv
    # Installing the OpenAI integration
    uv add langchain-openai
    # Installing the Anthropic integration
    uv add langchain-anthropic
    ```
</CodeGroup>





See the [integrations page](/oss/python/integrations/providers) for a full list of available integrations.
