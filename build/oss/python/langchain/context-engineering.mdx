The hard part of building agents (or any LLM application) is making them reliable enough.
While they may work for a prototype, they often mess up in more real world and widespread use cases.

Why do they mess up?

When agents mess up, it is because the LLM call inside the agent messes up.
When LLMs mess up, they mess up for one of two reasons:

1. The underlying LLM is just not good enough
2. The "right" context was not passed to the LLM

More often than not - it is actually the second reason that causes agents to not be reliable.

Context engineering is building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task.
This is the number one job of AI Engineers (or anyone working on AI systems).
This lack of "right" context is the number one blocker for more reliable agents, and as such LangChain's agent abstractions are uniquely designed to facilitate context engineering.

## The core agent loop

It's important to understand the core agent loop to understand where context should be accessed and/or updated from.

The core agent loop is quite simple:
1. Get user input
2. Call LLM, asking it to either respond or call tools
3. If it decides to call tools - then go and execute those tools
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until it decides to finish

The agent may have access to a lot of different context throughout this loop.
What ultimately matters is the context that is ultimately passed to the LLM.
This consists of the final prompt (or list of messages) and the tools it has access to.

## The model

The model (including specific model parameters) that you use is a key part of the agent loop.
It drives the whole agent's reasoning logic.

One reason the agent could mess up is the model you are using is just not good enough.
In order to build reliable agents, you have to have access to all the possible models.
LangChain, with its standard model interfaces, supports this - we have over 50 different provider integrations.

Model choice is also related to context engineering, in two ways.

First, the way you pass the context to the LLM may depend on what LLM you are using.
Some model providers are better at JSON, some at XML.
The context engineering you do may be specific to the model choice.

Second, the right model to use in the agent loop may depend on the context you want to pass it.
As an obvious example - some models have different context windows.
If the context in an agent builds up, you may want to use one model provider while the context is small, and then once it gets too large for that model's context window you may want to switch to another model.

## Types of context

There are a few different types of context that can be used to construct the context that is ultimately passed to the LLM.

**Instructions:** Base instructions from the developer, commonly referred to as the system prompt.
This may be static or dynamic.

**Tools:** What tools the agent has access to.
The names and descriptions and arguments of these are just as important as the text in the prompt.

**Structured output:** What format the agent should respond in.
The name and description and arguments of these are just as important as the text in the prompt.


**Session context:** We also call this "short term memory" in the docs.
In the context of a conversation, this is most easily thought of the list of messages that make up the conversation.
But there can often be other, more structured information that you may want the agent to access or update throughout the session.
The agent can read and write this context.
This context is often put directly into the context that is passed to the LLM.
Examples include: messages, files.

**Long term memory:** This is information that should persist across sessions (conversations).
Examples include: extracted preferences

**Runtime configuration context:** This is context that is not the "state" or "memory" of the agent, but rather configuration for a given agent run.
This is not modified by the agent, and typically isn't passed into the LLM, but is used to guide the agent's behavior or look up other context.
Examples include: user ID, DB connections


## Context engineering with LangChain

Now we understand the basic agent loop, the importance of the model you use, and the different types of context that exist.
Let's explore the concrete patterns LangChain provides for context engineering.

### Managing instructions (system prompts)

#### Static instructions

For fixed instructions that don't change, use the `system_prompt` parameter:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[...],
    system_prompt="You are a customer support agent. Be helpful, concise, and professional."
)
```




#### Dynamic instructions

For instructions that depend on context (user profile, preferences, session data), use the `@dynamic_prompt` middleware:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import dynamic_prompt, ModelRequest

@dataclass
class Context:
    user_id: str

@dynamic_prompt
def personalized_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:
    # Access runtime context
    user_id = request.runtime.context.user_id

    # Look up user preferences from long-term memory
    store = request.runtime.store
    user_prefs = store.get(("users",), user_id)

    # Access session state
    message_count = len(request.state["messages"])

    base = "You are a helpful assistant."

    if user_prefs:
        style = user_prefs.value.get("communication_style", "balanced")
        base += f"\nUser prefers {style} responses."

    if message_count > 10:
        base += "\nThis is a long conversation - be extra concise."

    return base

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[...],
    middleware=[personalized_prompt],
    context_schema=Context
)

# Use the agent with context
result = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Help me debug this code"}]},
    context=Context(user_id="user_123")
)
```




<Tip>
**When to use each:**
- **Static prompts**: Base instructions that never change
- **Dynamic prompts**: Personalization, A/B testing, context-dependent behavior
</Tip>

### Managing conversation context (messages)

Long conversations can exceed context windows or degrade model performance. Use middleware to manage conversation history:

#### Trimming messages

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import before_model, AgentState
from langchain.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES
from langgraph.runtime import Runtime

@before_model
def trim_messages(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime) -> dict | None:
    """Keep only the most recent messages to stay within context window."""
    messages = state["messages"]

    if len(messages) <= 10:
        return None  # No trimming needed

    # Keep system message + last 8 messages
    return {
        "messages": [
            RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES),
            messages[0],  # System message
            *messages[-8:]  # Recent messages
        ]
    }

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[...],
    middleware=[trim_messages]
)
```




For more sophisticated message management, use the built-in [SummarizationMiddleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware#summarization) which automatically summarizes old messages when approaching token limits.

See [Before model hook](/oss/python/langchain/agents#before-model-hook) for more examples.

### Contextual tool execution

Tools can access runtime context, session state, and long-term memory to make context-aware decisions:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime
from langchain.agents import create_agent

@dataclass
class Context:
    user_id: str
    api_key: str

@tool
def search_documents(
    query: str,
    runtime: ToolRuntime[Context]
) -> str:
    """Search through documents."""
    # Access runtime context for user-specific configuration
    user_id = runtime.context.user_id

    # Access long-term memory for user preferences
    store = runtime.store
    search_prefs = store.get(("preferences", user_id), "search")

    # Access session state
    conversation_history = runtime.state["messages"]

    # Use all context to perform a better search
    results = perform_search(query, user_id, search_prefs, conversation_history)
    return f"Found {len(results)} results: {results}"

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[search_documents],
    context_schema=Context
)
```


See [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) for comprehensive examples of accessing state, context, and memory in tools.

### Dynamic tool selection

Control which tools the agent can access based on context, state, or user permissions:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import wrap_model_call, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
from typing import Callable

@wrap_model_call
def permission_based_tools(
    request: ModelRequest,
    handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse]
) -> ModelResponse:
    """Filter tools based on user permissions."""
    user_role = request.runtime.context.get("user_role", "viewer")

    if user_role == "admin":
        # Admins get all tools
        pass
    elif user_role == "editor":
        # Editors can't delete
        request.tools = [t for t in request.tools if t.name != "delete_data"]
    else:
        # Viewers get read-only tools
        request.tools = [t for t in request.tools if t.name.startswith("read_")]

    return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",
    tools=[read_data, write_data, delete_data],
    middleware=[permission_based_tools]
)
```




See [Dynamically selecting tools](/oss/python/langchain/middleware#dynamically-selecting-tools) for more examples.

### Dynamic model selection

Switch models based on conversation complexity, context window needs, or cost optimization:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import wrap_model_call, ModelRequest, ModelResponse
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from typing import Callable

@wrap_model_call
def adaptive_model(
    request: ModelRequest,
    handler: Callable[[ModelRequest], ModelResponse]
) -> ModelResponse:
    """Use different models based on conversation length."""
    message_count = len(request.messages)

    if message_count > 20:
        # Long conversation - use model with larger context window
        request.model = init_chat_model("anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929")
    elif message_count > 10:
        # Medium conversation - use mid-tier model
        request.model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o")
    else:
        # Short conversation - use efficient model
        request.model = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o-mini")

    return handler(request)

agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o-mini",  # Default model
    tools=[...],
    middleware=[adaptive_model]
)
```




See [Dynamic model](/oss/python/langchain/agents#dynamic-model) for more examples.

## Best practices

1. **Start simple** - Begin with static prompts and tools, add dynamics only when needed
2. **Test incrementally** - Add one context engineering feature at a time
3. **Monitor performance** - Track model calls, token usage, and latency
4. **Use built-in middleware** - Leverage [SummarizationMiddleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware#summarization), [LLMToolSelectorMiddleware](/oss/python/langchain/middleware#llm-tool-selector), etc.
5. **Document your context strategy** - Make it clear what context is being passed and why
