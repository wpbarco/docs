This quickstart takes you from a simple setup to a fully functional AI agent in just a few minutes.

## Build a basic agent

Start by creating a simple agent that can answer questions and call tools. The agent will use Claude Sonnet 4.5 as its language model, a basic weather function as a tool, and a simple prompt to guide its behavior.

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    tools=[get_weather],
    system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```




<Info>
    For this example, you will need to set up a [Claude (Anthropic)](https://www.anthropic.com/) account and get an API key. Then, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal.

## Build a real-world agent

Next, build a practical weather forecasting agent that demonstrates key production concepts:

1. **Detailed system prompts** for better agent behavior
2. **Create tools** that integrate with external data
3. **Model configuration** for consistent responses
4. **Structured output** for predictable results
5. **Conversational memory** for chat-like interactions
6. **Create and run the agent** create a fully functional agent

Let's walk through each step:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Define the system prompt">
        The system prompt defines your agentâ€™s role and behavior. Keep it specific and actionable:

        ```python wrap
        system_prompt = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

        You have access to two tools:

        - get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
        - get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

        If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean wherever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Create tools">
        [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) let a model interact with external systems by calling functions you define.
        Tools can depend on [runtime context](/oss/python/langchain/runtime) and also interact with [agent memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory).

        Notice below how the `get_user_location` tool uses runtime context:

        ```python
        from dataclasses import dataclass
        from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime

        @tool
        def get_weather_for_location(city: str) -> str:
            """Get weather for a given city."""
            return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

        @dataclass
        class Context:
            """Custom runtime context schema."""
            user_id: str

        @tool
        def get_user_location(runtime: ToolRuntime[Context]) -> str:
            """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
            user_id = runtime.context.user_id
            return "Florida" if user_id == "1" else "SF"
        ```

        <Tip>
            Tools should be well-documented: their name, description, and argument names become part of the model's prompt.
            LangChain's [`@tool` decorator](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/tools/#langchain.tools.tool) adds metadata and enables runtime injection via the `ToolRuntime` parameter.
        </Tip>



    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your model">
        Set up your [language model](/oss/python/langchain/models) with the right [parameters](/oss/python/langchain/models#parameters) for your use case:

        ```python
        from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

        model = init_chat_model(
            "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
            temperature=0.5,
            timeout=10,
            max_tokens=1000
        )
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Define response format">
        Optionally, define a structured response format if you need the agent responses to match
        a specific schema.

        ```python
        from dataclasses import dataclass

        # We use a dataclass here, but Pydantic models are also supported.
        @dataclass
        class ResponseFormat:
            """Response schema for the agent."""
            # A punny response (always required)
            punny_response: str
            # Any interesting information about the weather if available
            weather_conditions: str | None = None
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Add memory">
        Add [memory](/oss/python/langchain/short-term-memory) to your agent to maintain state across interactions. This allows
        the agent to remember previous conversations and context.

        ```python
        from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

        checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
        ```




        <Info>
            In production, use a persistent checkpointer that saves to a database.
            See [Add and manage memory](/oss/python/langgraph/add-memory#manage-short-term-memory) for more details.
        </Info>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create and run the agent">
        Now assemble your agent with all the components and run it!

        ```python
        agent = create_agent(
            model=model,
            system_prompt=system_prompt,
            tools=[get_user_location, get_weather_for_location],
            context_schema=Context,
            response_format=ResponseFormat,
            checkpointer=checkpointer
        )

        # `thread_id` is a unique identifier for a given conversation.
        config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

        response = agent.invoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
            config=config,
            context=Context(user_id="1")
        )

        print(response['structured_response'])
        # ResponseFormat(
        #     punny_response="Florida is still having a 'sun-derful' day! The sunshine is playing 'ray-dio' hits all day long! I'd say it's the perfect weather for some 'solar-bration'! If you were hoping for rain, I'm afraid that idea is all 'washed up' - the forecast remains 'clear-ly' brilliant!",
        #     weather_conditions="It's always sunny in Florida!"
        # )


        # Note that we can continue the conversation using the same `thread_id`.
        response = agent.invoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
            config=config,
            context=Context(user_id="1")
        )

        print(response['structured_response'])
        # ResponseFormat(
        #     punny_response="You're 'thund-erfully' welcome! It's always a 'breeze' to help you stay 'current' with the weather. I'm just 'cloud'-ing around waiting to 'shower' you with more forecasts whenever you need them. Have a 'sun-sational' day in the Florida sunshine!",
        #     weather_conditions=None
        # )
        ```
