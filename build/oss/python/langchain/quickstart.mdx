Welcome to LangChain! This quickstart will take you from zero to a fully functional AI agent in just a few minutes. We'll start simple and gradually build up to something more sophisticated.

## Super quick start

Let's begin with the absolute basics - creating a simple agent that can answer questions and use tools:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent

def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get weather for a given city."""
    return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

agent = create_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
    tools=[get_weather],
    prompt="You are a helpful assistant",
)

# Run the agent
agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
```




**What just happened?** We created an agent with:
- A language model (Claude 3.7 Sonnet)
- A simple tool (weather function)
- A basic prompt
- The ability to invoke it with messages

## Building a real-world agent

Now let's create something more practical. We'll build a weather forecasting agent that demonstrates the key concepts you'll use in production:

1. **Detailed system prompts** for better agent behavior
2. **Real-world tools** that integrate with external data
3. **Model configuration** for consistent responses
4. **Structured output** for predictable results
5. **Conversational memory** for chat-like interactions

Let's walk through each step:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Define the system prompt">
        The system prompt is your agent's personality and instructions. Make it
        specific and actionable:

        ```python wrap
        system_prompt = """You are an expert weather forecaster, who speaks in puns.

        You have access to two tools:

        - get_weather_for_location: use this to get the weather for a specific location
        - get_user_location: use this to get the user's location

        If a user asks you for the weather, make sure you know the location. If you can tell from the question that they mean whereever they are, use the get_user_location tool to find their location."""
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Create tools">
        [Tools](/oss/python/langchain/tools) are functions your agent can call. They should be well-documented. Oftentimes, tools will want to connect to external systems, and will rely on runtime configuration to do so. Notice here how the `get_user_location` tool does exactly that:

        ```python
        from langchain_core.tools import tool

        def get_weather_for_location(city: str) -> str:  # (1)!
            """Get weather for a given city."""
            return f"It's always sunny in {city}!"

        from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

        USER_LOCATION = {
            "1": "Florida",
            "2": "SF"
        }

        @tool
        def get_user_location(config: RunnableConfig) -> str:
            """Retrieve user information based on user ID."""
            user_id = config["context"].get("user_id")
            return USER_LOCATION[user_id]
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure your model">
        Set up your language model with the right parameters for your use case:

        ```python
        from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

        model = init_chat_model(
            "anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest",
            temperature=0
        )
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Define response format">
        Structured outputs ensure your agent returns data in a predictable
        format. Here, we use Python's [`DataClass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
        dictionary.

        ```python
        from dataclasses import dataclass

        @dataclass
        class WeatherResponse:
            conditions: str
            punny_response: str
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Add memory">
        Enable your agent to remember conversation history:

        ```python
        from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

        checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
        ```



    </Step>
    <Step title="Bring it all together">
        Now assemble your agent with all the components:

        ```python
        agent = create_agent(
            model=model,
            prompt=system_prompt,
            tools=[get_user_location, get_weather_for_location],
            response_format=WeatherResponse,
            checkpointer=checkpointer
        )

        config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
        context = {"user_id": "1"}
        response = agent.invoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather outside?"}]},
            config=config,
            context=context
        )

        response['structured_response']

        response = agent.invoke(
            {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "thank you!"}]},
            config=config,
            context=context
        )

        response['structured_response']
        ```



    </Step>
</Steps>

## What you've built

Congratulations! You now have a sophisticated AI agent that can:
- **Understand context** and remember conversations
- **Use multiple tools** intelligently
- **Provide structured responses** in a consistent format
- **Handle user-specific information** through context
- **Maintain conversation state** across interactions
