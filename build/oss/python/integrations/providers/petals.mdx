This page covers how to use the Petals ecosystem within LangChain.
It is broken into two parts: installation and setup, and then references to specific Petals wrappers.

## Installation and Setup
- Install with `pip install petals`
- Get a Hugging Face api key and set it as an environment variable (`HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`)

## Wrappers

### LLM

There exists an Petals LLM wrapper, which you can access with
```python
from langchain_community.llms import Petals
```
