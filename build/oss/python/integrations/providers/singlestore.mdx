title: SingleStore Integration
---

[SingleStore](https://singlestore.com/) is a high-performance, distributed SQL database designed to excel in both [cloud](https://www.singlestore.com/cloud/) and on-premises environments. It offers a versatile feature set, seamless deployment options, and exceptional performance.

This integration provides the following components to leverage SingleStore's capabilities:

- **`SingleStoreLoader`**: Load documents directly from a SingleStore database table.
- **`SingleStoreSemanticCache`**: Use SingleStore as a semantic cache for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
- **`SingleStoreChatMessageHistory`**: Store and retrieve chat message history in SingleStore.
- **`SingleStoreVectorStore`**: Store document embeddings and perform fast vector and full-text searches.

These components enable efficient document storage, embedding management, and advanced search capabilities, combining full-text and vector-based search for fast and accurate queries.

```python
from langchain_singlestore import (
    SingleStoreChatMessageHistory,
    SingleStoreLoader,
    SingleStoreSemanticCache,
    SingleStoreVectorStore,
)
```
