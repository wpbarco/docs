>[Hologres](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/introduction) is a unified real-time data warehousing service developed by Alibaba Cloud. You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time.
>`Hologres` supports standard `SQL` syntax, is compatible with `PostgreSQL`, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services.

>`Hologres` provides **vector database** functionality by adopting [Proxima](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/vector-processing).
>`Proxima` is a high-performance software library developed by `Alibaba DAMO Academy`. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open-source software such as Faiss. Proxima allows you to search for similar text or image embeddings with high throughput and low latency. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.
