>[Motherduck](https://motherduck.com/) is a managed DuckDB-in-the-cloud service.

## Installation and Setup

First, you need to install `duckdb` python package.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install duckdb
```

```bash uv
uv add duckdb
```
</CodeGroup>

You will also need to sign up for an account at [Motherduck](https://motherduck.com/)

After that, you should set up a connection string - we mostly integrate with Motherduck through SQLAlchemy.
The connection string is likely in the form:

```
token="..."

conn_str = f"duckdb:///md:{token}@my_db"
```

## SQLChain

You can use the SQLChain to query data in your Motherduck instance in natural language.

```
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain_experimental.sql import SQLDatabaseChain
db = SQLDatabase.from_uri(conn_str)
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain.from_llm(OpenAI(temperature=0), db, verbose=True)
```


## LLMCache

You can also easily use Motherduck to cache LLM requests.
Once again this is done through the SQLAlchemy wrapper.

```
import sqlalchemy
from langchain.globals import set_llm_cache
eng = sqlalchemy.create_engine(conn_str)
set_llm_cache(SQLAlchemyCache(engine=eng))
```
