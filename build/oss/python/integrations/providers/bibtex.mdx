>[BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) is a file format and reference management system commonly used in conjunction with `LaTeX` typesetting. It serves as a way to organize and store bibliographic information for academic and research documents.

## Installation and Setup

We have to install the `bibtexparser` and `pymupdf` packages.

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install bibtexparser pymupdf
```

```bash uv
uv add bibtexparser pymupdf
```
</CodeGroup>


## Document loader

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/bibtex).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import BibtexLoader
```
