>[Connery SDK](https://github.com/connery-io/connery-sdk) is an NPM package that
> includes both an SDK and a CLI, designed for the development of plugins and actions.
>
>The CLI automates many things in the development process. The SDK
> offers a JavaScript API for defining plugins and actions and packaging them
> into a plugin server with a standardized REST API generated from the metadata.
> The plugin server handles authorization, input validation, and logging.
> So you can focus on the logic of your actions.
>
> See the use cases and examples in the [Connery SDK documentation](https://sdk.connery.io/docs/use-cases/)
