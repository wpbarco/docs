> [Typesense](https://typesense.org) is an open-source, in-memory search engine, that you can either
> [self-host](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html#option-2-local-machine-self-hosting) or run
> on [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org/).
> `Typesense` focuses on performance by storing the entire index in RAM (with a backup on disk) and also
> focuses on providing an out-of-the-box developer experience by simplifying available options and setting good defaults.
