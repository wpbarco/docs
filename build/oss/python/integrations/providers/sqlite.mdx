title: SQLite
---

>[SQLite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) is a database engine written in the
> C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that
> software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of
> embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine, as it is
> used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile phones, and other embedded systems.

## Installation and Setup

```

```bash uv
uv add SQLAlchemy
```
</CodeGroup>

## Vector Store

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/sqlitevec).
