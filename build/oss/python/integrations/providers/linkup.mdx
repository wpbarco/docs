> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) provides an API to connect LLMs to the web and the Linkup Premium Partner sources.

## Installation and Setup

To use the Linkup provider, you first need a valid API key, which you can find by signing-up [here](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up).
You will also need the `langchain-linkup` package, which you can install using pip:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install langchain-linkup
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain-linkup
```
</CodeGroup>

## Retriever

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers/linkup_search).

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```

## Tools

See a [usage example](/oss/python/integrations/tools/linkup_search).

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchTool

tool = LinkupSearchTool(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    output_type="searchResults",  # "searchResults", "sourcedAnswer" or "structured"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```
