```

```python
api_key = "KEY"  # obtained from Mojeek Website
```

```python
search = MojeekSearch.config(api_key=api_key, search_kwargs={"t": 10})
```

In `search_kwargs` you can add any search parameter that you can find on [Mojeek Documentation](https://www.mojeek.com/support/api/search/request_parameters.html)
