title: Steam Toolkit
---

>[Steam (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)) is a video game digital distribution service and storefront developed by `Valve Corporation`. It provides game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles. `Steam` offers various features, like game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game streaming services.

>[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about/) is the ultimate destination for playing, discussing, and creating games.

Steam toolkit has two tools:

- `Game Details`
- `Recommended Games`

This guide provides a walkthrough of using Steam API with LangChain to retrieve Steam game recommendations based on your current Steam Game Inventory or to gather information regarding some Steam Games which you provide.

## Setting up

We have to install two python libraries.

## Imports

```python
pip install -qU python-steam-api python-decouple steamspypi
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Assign Environmental Variables

To use this toolkit, please have your OpenAI API Key, Steam API key (from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)) and your own SteamID handy. Once you have received a Steam API Key, you can input it as an environmental variable below.
The toolkit will read the "STEAM_KEY" API Key as an environmental variable to authenticate you so please set them here. You will also need to set your "OPENAI_API_KEY" and your "STEAM_ID".

```python
import os

os.environ["STEAM_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["STEAM_ID"] = ""
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Initialization

Initialize the LLM, SteamWebAPIWrapper, SteamToolkit and most importantly the langchain agent to process your query!

## Example

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.steam.toolkit import SteamToolkit
from langchain_community.utilities.steam import SteamWebAPIWrapper

steam = SteamWebAPIWrapper()
tools = [steam.run]
```

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent

agent = create_agent("openai:gpt-4.1-mini", tools)
```

```python
events = agent.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", "can you give the information about the game Terraria?")]},
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```output
