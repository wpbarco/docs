title: Azure Cognitive Services Toolkit
---

This toolkit is used to interact with the `Azure Cognitive Services API` to achieve some multimodal capabilities.

Currently There are four tools bundled in this toolkit:

- AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool: used to extract caption, objects, tags, and text from images. (Note: this tool is not available on Mac OS yet, due to the dependency on `azure-ai-vision` package, which is only supported on Windows and Linux currently.)
- AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool: used to extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from documents.
- AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool: used to transcribe speech to text.
- AzureCogsText2SpeechTool: used to synthesize text to speech.
- AzureCogsTextAnalyticsHealthTool: used to extract healthcare entities.

First, you need to set up an Azure account and create a Cognitive Services resource. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows) to create a resource.

Then, you need to get the endpoint, key and region of your resource, and set them as environment variables. You can find them in the "Keys and Endpoint" page of your resource.

```python
pip install -qU  azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-ai-textanalytics > /dev/null

# For Windows/Linux
pip install -qU  azure-ai-vision > /dev/null
```

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-"
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_REGION"] = ""
```

## Create the Toolkit

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()
```

```python
[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]
```

```output
['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']
```

## Use within an Agent

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
agent.run(
    "What can I make with these ingredients?"
    "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
)
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Action:

  "action_input": "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
}
\`\`\`


Observation: Caption: a group of eggs and flour in bowls
Objects: Egg, Egg, Food
Tags: dairy, ingredient, indoor, thickening agent, food, mixing bowl, powder, flour, egg, bowl
Thought: I can use the objects and tags to suggest recipes
Action:
\`\`\`
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!"
}
\`\`\`

> Finished chain.
```

```output
'You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!'
```

```python
audio_file = agent.run("Tell me a joke and read it out for me.")
```

```output

Thought: I have the audio file of the joke
Action:

display.display(audio)
```

```python
agent.run(

another brother who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress echocardiogram done on July , 2001 ,
which showed no wall motion abnormalities , but this was a difficult study due to body habitus. The patient went for six minutes with
minimal ST depressions in the anterior lateral leads , thought due to fatigue and wrist pain , his anginal equivalent. Due to the patient's
increased symptoms and family history and history left main disease with total occasional of his RCA was referred for revascularization with open heart surgery.

List all the diagnoses.
