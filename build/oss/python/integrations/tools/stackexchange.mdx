title: StackExchange
---

>[Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) is a network of question-and-answer (Q&A) websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic, where questions, answers, and users are subject to a reputation award process. The reputation system allows the sites to be self-moderating.

The `StackExchange` component integrates the StackExchange API into LangChain allowing access to the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) site of the Stack Excchange network. Stack Overflow focuses on computer programming.

This notebook goes over how to use the `StackExchange` component.

We first have to install the python package stackapi which implements the Stack Exchange API.

```python
pip install -U stackapi
```

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import StackExchangeAPIWrapper

stackexchange = StackExchangeAPIWrapper()

stackexchange.run("zsh: command not found: python")
```
