title: Gitlab Toolkit
---

The `Gitlab` toolkit contains tools that enable an LLM agent to interact with a gitlab repository.
The tool is a wrapper for the [python-gitlab](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab) library.

## Quickstart

1. Install the python-gitlab library
2. Create a Gitlab personal access token
3. Set your environmental variables
4. Pass the tools to your agent with `toolkit.get_tools()`

Each of these steps will be explained in great detail below.

1. **Get Issues**- fetches issues from the repository.

2. **Get Issue**- fetches details about a specific issue.

3. **Comment on Issue**- posts a comment on a specific issue.

4. **Create Merge Request**- creates a merge request from the bot's working branch to the base branch.

5. **Create File**- creates a new file in the repository.

6. **Read File**- reads a file from the repository.

7. **Update File**- updates a file in the repository.

8. **Delete File**- deletes a file from the repository.

## Setup

### 1. Install the `python-gitlab` library

```python
pip install -qU  python-gitlab langchain-community
```

### 2. Create a Gitlab personal access token

[Follow the instructions here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) to create a Gitlab personal access token. Make sure your app has the following repository permissions:

* read_api
* read_repository
* write_repository

### 3. Set Environmental Variables

Before initializing your agent, the following environmental variables need to be set:

* **GITLAB_URL** - The URL hosted Gitlab. Defaults to "[gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com)".
* **GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN**- The personal access token you created in the last step
* **GITLAB_REPOSITORY**- The name of the Gitlab repository you want your bot to act upon. Must follow the format \{username\}/\{repo-name\}.
* **GITLAB_BRANCH**- The branch where the bot will make its commits. Defaults to 'main.'
* **GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH**- The base branch of your repo, usually either 'main' or 'master.' This is where merge requests will base from. Defaults to 'main.'

## Example: Simple Agent

```python
import os

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits.gitlab.toolkit import GitLabToolkit
from langchain_community.utilities.gitlab import GitLabAPIWrapper
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
# Set your environment variables using os.environ
os.environ["GITLAB_URL"] = "https://gitlab.example.org"
os.environ["GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN"] = ""
os.environ["GITLAB_REPOSITORY"] = "username/repo-name"
os.environ["GITLAB_BRANCH"] = "bot-branch-name"
os.environ["GITLAB_BASE_BRANCH"] = "main"

# This example also requires an OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
gitlab = GitLabAPIWrapper()
toolkit = GitLabToolkit.from_gitlab_api_wrapper(gitlab)
agent = initialize_agent(
    toolkit.get_tools(), llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)
```

```python
agent.run(
    "You have the software engineering capabilities of a Google Principle engineer. You are tasked with completing issues on a gitlab repository. Please look at the open issues and complete them by creating merge requests that solve the issues."
)
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
 I need to look at the open issues and figure out how to solve them.
Action: Get Issues
Action Input: N/A
Observation: Found 1 issues:
[{'title': 'Add tic-tac-toe game', 'number': 15}]
Thought: I need to look at the details of this issue to figure out how to solve it.
Action: Get Issue
Action Input: 15
Observation: {"title": "Add tic-tac-toe game", "body": "Create a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Create a new file called game.html and store the code there.", "comments": "[]"}
Thought: I need to create the game.html file and add the code.
Action: Create File
Action Input: game.html

Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: I have created a merge request with number 12 that solves issue 15.

> Finished chain.
```

```output
