title: Bodo DataFrames
---

This notebook gives an overview of how to create agents and perform question answering over large datasets
with the [langchain-bodo](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-bodo/) integration package, which uses [Bodo DataFrames](https://github.com/bodo-ai/Bodo) and the `Python` agent under the hood.

Bodo DataFrames is a high performance DataFrame library that can automatically accelerate and scale
Pandas code with a simple import change (see examples below). Because of it's strong Pandas compatibility, Bodo DataFrames
enables LLMs, which are typically good at generating Pandas code, to answer questions about larger
datasets more efficiently and scales generated code beyond the limitations of Pandas.

**NOTE: The `Python` agent executes LLM generated Python code - this can be bad if the LLM generated Python code is harmful. Use cautiously.**

## Setup

Before running examples, copy the [titanic dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pandas-dev/pandas/main/doc/data/titanic.csv)
and save locally as `titanic.csv`.

Installing langchain-bodo will also install dependencies Bodo and Pandas:

```bash pip
pip install --quiet -U langchain-bodo langchain-openai
```

### Credentials

Bodo DataFrames is free and does not require additional credentials.
The examples use OpenAI models, if not already configured, set your OPENAI_API_KEY:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Open AI API key:\n")
```

## Creating and invoking agents

The following examples are borrowed from [the Pandas DataFrames agent notebook](/oss/python/integrations/tools/pandas) with some modifications to highlight key differences.

This first example shows how you can directly pass Bodo DataFrame to `create_bodo_dataframes_agent` and
ask a simple question.

```python
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType
from langchain_bodo import create_bodo_dataframes_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Path to local titanic data
datapath = "titanic.csv"
```

```python
import bodo.pandas as pd
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

df = pd.read_csv(datapath)
```

## Using `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION`

This shows how to initialize the agent using the `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` agent type.

```python
agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), df, verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True
)
```

## Using OpenAI Functions

This shows how to initialize the agent using the OPENAI_FUNCTIONS agent type. Note that this is an alternative to the above.

```python
agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106"),
    df,
    verbose=True,
    agent_type=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,
    allow_dangerous_code=True,
)
```

```python
agent.invoke("how many rows are there?")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...

Invoking: `python_repl_ast` with `{'query': 'len(df)'}`

891There are 891 rows in the dataframe.

> Finished chain.
```

```output
{'input': 'how many rows are there?', 'output': 'There are 891 rows in the dataframe.'}
```

## Creating and invoking agents with Bodo DataFrames and preprocessing

This example shows a slightly more complex use case of passing a Bodo DataFrame to `create_bodo_dataframes_agent`
with some additional preprocessing.
Since Bodo DataFrames are lazily evaluated, you can potentially save on computation if not all columns
are needed to answer the question. Note that the DataFrame(s) passed to the agent can also be
larger than the available memory.

```python
df2 = df[["Age", "Pclass", "Survived", "Fare"]]

# Potentially expensive computation using df.apply:
df2["Age"] = df2.apply(lambda x: x["Age"] if x["Pclass"] == 3 else 0, axis=1)

agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), df2, verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True
)
```

```python
# The bdf["Age"] column is lazy and will not evaluate unless explicitly used by the agent.
agent.invoke("Out of the people who survived, what was their average fare?")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: We need to filter the dataframe to only include rows where Survived is equal to 1, then calculate the average of the Fare column.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df[df["Survived"] == 1]["Fare"].mean()48.3954076023391748.39540760233917 is the average fare for people who survived.
Final Answer: 48.39540760233917

> Finished chain.
```

```output
{'input': 'Out of the people who survived, what was their average fare?', 'output': '48.39540760233917'}
```

## Multi DataFrame Example

You can also pass multiple DataFrames to the agent.
Note that while Bodo DataFrames supports most common compute intensive operations in Pandas,
if the agent generates code that is not currently supported (see warnings below), the DataFrames
will be converted back to Pandas to prevent errors.

Refer to the [Bodo DataFrames API documentation](https://docs.bodo.ai/latest/api_docs/dataframe_lib/) for more details about the currently supported features.

```python
agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), [df, df2], verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True
)
agent.invoke("how many rows in the age column are different?")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: I need to compare the two dataframes and count the number of rows where the age values are different.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: len(df1[df1["Age"] != df2["Age"]])

... BodoLibFallbackWarning: Series._cmp_method is not implemented in Bodo DataFrames for the specified arguments yet. Falling back to Pandas (may be slow or run out of memory).
Exception: binary operation arguments must have the same dataframe source.
    warnings.warn(BodoLibFallbackWarning(msg))
... BodoLibFallbackWarning: DataFrame.__getitem__ is not implemented in Bodo DataFrames for the specified arguments yet. Falling back to Pandas (may be slow or run out of memory).
Exception: DataFrame getitem: Only selecting columns or filtering with BodoSeries is supported.
    warnings.warn(BodoLibFallbackWarning(msg))

359359 rows have different age values.
Final Answer: 359

> Finished chain.
```

```output
{'input': 'how many rows in the age column are different?', 'output': '359'}
```

## Optimizing agent invocation with `number_of_head_rows`

By default, the head of the DataFrame(s) are embedded into the prompt as a markdown table.
Since Bodo DataFrames are lazily evaluated, this head operation can be optimized, but can
still be slow in some cases. As an optimization, you can set number of rows in
the head to 0 so that no evaluation occurs during prompting.

```python
agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0),
    df,
    verbose=True,
    number_of_head_rows=0,
    allow_dangerous_code=True,
)
agent.invoke("What is the average age of all female passengers?")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: We need to filter the dataframe to only include female passengers and then calculate the average age.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df[df["Sex"] == "female"]["Age"].mean()27.91570881226053727.915708812260537 seems like a reasonable average age for female passengers.
Final Answer: 27.915708812260537

> Finished chain.
```

```output
{'input': 'What is the average age of all female passengers?', 'output': '27.915708812260537'}
```

## Passing Pandas DataFrames

You can also pass one or more Pandas DataFrames to `create_bodo_dataframes_agent`. The DataFrame(s) will
be converted to Bodo before being passed to the agent.

```python
import pandas

pdf = pandas.read_csv(datapath)

agent = create_bodo_dataframes_agent(
    OpenAI(temperature=0), pdf, verbose=True, allow_dangerous_code=True
)
```

```python
agent.invoke("What is the square root of the average age?")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Thought: We need to calculate the average age first and then take the square root.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: df["Age"].mean()29.69911764705882 Now we have the average age, we can take the square root.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: math.sqrt(df["Age"].mean())NameError: name 'math' is not defined We need to import the math library to use the sqrt function.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: import math Now we can take the square root.
Action: python_repl_ast
Action Input: math.sqrt(df["Age"].mean())5.449689683556195 I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: 5.449689683556195

> Finished chain.
```

```output
{'input': 'What is the square root of the average age?', 'output': '5.449689683556195'}
```
