title: Reddit Search
---

In this notebook, we learn how the Reddit search tool works.
First make sure that you have installed praw with the command below:

```python
pip install -qU  praw
```

Then you need to set you need to set up the proper API keys and environment variables. You would need to create a Reddit user account and get credentials. So, create a Reddit user account by going to [www.reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com)  and signing up.
Then get your credentials by going to [www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and creating an app.
You should have your client_id and secret from creating the app. Now, you can paste those strings in client_id and client_secret variable.
Note: You can put any string for user_agent

```python
client_id = ""
client_secret = ""
user_agent = ""
```

```python
from langchain_community.tools.reddit_search.tool import RedditSearchRun
from langchain_community.utilities.reddit_search import RedditSearchAPIWrapper

search = RedditSearchRun(
    api_wrapper=RedditSearchAPIWrapper(
        reddit_client_id=client_id,
        reddit_client_secret=client_secret,
        reddit_user_agent=user_agent,
    )
)
```

You can then set your queries for example, what subreddit you want to query, how many posts you want to be returned, how you would like the result to be sorted etc.

```python
from langchain_community.tools.reddit_search.tool import RedditSearchSchema

search_params = RedditSearchSchema(
    query="beginner", sort="new", time_filter="week", subreddit="python", limit="2"
)
```

Finally run the search and get your results

```python
result = search.run(tool_input=search_params.dict())
```

```python
print(result)
```

Here is an example of printing the result.
Note: You may get different output depending on the newest post in the subreddit but the formatting should be similar.

>This is a Chinese Checkers (aka Sternhalma) game for 2 to 3 players. The bots I wrote are easy to beat, as they're mainly for debugging the game logic part of the code. However, you can write up your own custom bots. There is a guide at the github page.

## Using tool with an agent chain

Reddit search functionality is also provided as a multi-input tool. In this example, we adapt [existing code from the docs](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/memory/agent_with_memory/), and use ChatOpenAI to create an agent chain with memory. This agent chain is able to pull information from Reddit and use these posts to respond to subsequent input.

To run the example, add your reddit API access information and also get an OpenAI key from the [OpenAI API](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-api-key).

```python
# Adapted code from /docs/modules/agents/how_to/sharedmemory_for_tools

from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, StructuredChatAgent
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory, ReadOnlySharedMemory
from langchain_community.tools.reddit_search.tool import RedditSearchRun
from langchain_community.utilities.reddit_search import RedditSearchAPIWrapper
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Provide keys for Reddit
client_id = ""
client_secret = ""
user_agent = ""
# Provide key for OpenAI
openai_api_key = ""

template = """This is a conversation between a human and a bot:

{chat_history}

Write a summary of the conversation for {input}:
"""

prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["input", "chat_history"], template=template)
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")

prefix = """Have a conversation with a human, answering the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:"""
suffix = """Begin!"

{chat_history}
Question: {input}
{agent_scratchpad}"""

tools = [
    RedditSearchRun(
        api_wrapper=RedditSearchAPIWrapper(
            reddit_client_id=client_id,
            reddit_client_secret=client_secret,
            reddit_user_agent=user_agent,
        )
    )
]

prompt = StructuredChatAgent.create_prompt(
    prefix=prefix,
    tools=tools,
    suffix=suffix,
    input_variables=["input", "chat_history", "agent_scratchpad"],
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, openai_api_key=openai_api_key)

llm_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)
agent = StructuredChatAgent(llm_chain=llm_chain, verbose=True, tools=tools)
agent_chain = AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools(
    agent=agent, verbose=True, memory=memory, tools=tools
)

# Answering the first prompt requires usage of the Reddit search tool.
agent_chain.run(input="What is the newest post on r/langchain for the week?")
# Answering the subsequent prompt uses memory.
agent_chain.run(input="Who is the author of the post?")
```
