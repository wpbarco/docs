>[WatsonxLLM](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/fm_extensions.html#langchain) is a wrapper for IBM [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) foundation models.

This example shows how to communicate with `watsonx.ai` models using `LangChain`.

## Setup

To access IBM watsonx.ai models you'll need to create an IBM watsonx.ai account, get an API key, and install the `langchain-ibm` integration package.

### Credentials

The cell below defines the credentials required to work with watsonx Foundation Model inferencing.

**Action:** Provide the IBM Cloud user API key. For details, see
[Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui).

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

watsonx_api_key = getpass()
os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = watsonx_api_key
```

Additionaly you are able to pass additional secrets as an environment variable.

```python
import os

os.environ["WATSONX_URL"] = "your service instance url"
os.environ["WATSONX_TOKEN"] = "your token for accessing the CLOUD or CPD cluster"
os.environ["WATSONX_PASSWORD"] = "your password for accessing the CPD cluster"
os.environ["WATSONX_USERNAME"] = "your username for accessing the CPD cluster"
os.environ["WATSONX_INSTANCE_ID"] = "your instance_id for accessing the CPD cluster"
```

### Installation

The LangChain IBM integration lives in the `langchain-ibm` package:

```python
!pip install -qU langchain-ibm
```

## Instantiation

You might need to adjust model `parameters` for different models or tasks. For details, refer to [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/fm_model.html#metanames.GenTextParamsMetaNames).

```python
parameters = {
    "decoding_method": "sample",
    "max_new_tokens": 100,
    "min_new_tokens": 1,
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "top_k": 50,
    "top_p": 1,
}
```

Initialize the `WatsonxLLM` class with previously set parameters.

**Note**:

- To provide context for the API call, you must add `project_id` or `space_id`. For more information see [documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx-as-a-service?topic=projects).
- Depending on the region of your provisioned service instance, use one of the urls described [here](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/setup_cloud.html#authentication).

In this example, we’ll use the `project_id` and Dallas url.

You need to specify `model_id` that will be used for inferencing. All available models you can find in [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/fm_model.html#TextModels).

```python
from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM

watsonx_llm = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id="ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2",
    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    project_id="PASTE YOUR PROJECT_ID HERE",
    params=parameters,
)
```

Alternatively you can use Cloud Pak for Data credentials. For details, see [documentation](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/setup_cpd.html).

```python
watsonx_llm = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id="ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2",
    url="PASTE YOUR URL HERE",
    username="PASTE YOUR USERNAME HERE",
    password="PASTE YOUR PASSWORD HERE",
    instance_id="openshift",
    version="4.8",
    project_id="PASTE YOUR PROJECT_ID HERE",
    params=parameters,
)
```

Instead of `model_id`, you can also pass the `deployment_id` of the previously tuned model. The entire model tuning workflow is described in [Working with TuneExperiment and PromptTuner](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/pt_tune_experiment_run.html).

```python
watsonx_llm = WatsonxLLM(
    deployment_id="PASTE YOUR DEPLOYMENT_ID HERE",
    url="https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    project_id="PASTE YOUR PROJECT_ID HERE",
    params=parameters,
)
```

For certain requirements, there is an option to pass the IBM's [`APIClient`](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/base.html#apiclient) object into the `WatsonxLLM` class.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_ai import APIClient

api_client = APIClient(...)

watsonx_llm = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id="ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2",
    watsonx_client=api_client,
)
```

You can also pass the IBM's [`ModelInference`](https://ibm.github.io/watsonx-ai-python-sdk/fm_model_inference.html) object into the `WatsonxLLM` class.

```python
from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models import ModelInference

model = ModelInference(...)

watsonx_llm = WatsonxLLM(watsonx_model=model)
```

## Invocation

To obtain completions, you can call the model directly using a string prompt.

```python
# Calling a single prompt

watsonx_llm.invoke("Who is man's best friend?")
```

```output
"Man's best friend is his dog. Dogs are man's best friend because they are always there for you, they never judge you, and they love you unconditionally. Dogs are also great companions and can help reduce stress levels. "
```

```python
# Calling multiple prompts

watsonx_llm.generate(
    [
        "The fastest dog in the world?",
        "Describe your chosen dog breed",
    ]
)
```

```output
LLMResult(generations=[[Generation(text='The fastest dog in the world is the greyhound. Greyhounds can run up to 45 mph, which is about the same speed as a Usain Bolt.', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'eos_token'})], [Generation(text='The Labrador Retriever is a breed of retriever that was bred for hunting. They are a very smart breed and are very easy to train. They are also very loyal and will make great companions. ', generation_info={'finish_reason': 'eos_token'})]], llm_output={'token_usage': {'generated_token_count': 82, 'input_token_count': 13}, 'model_id': 'ibm/granite-13b-instruct-v2', 'deployment_id': None}, run=[RunInfo(run_id=UUID('750b8a0f-8846-456d-93d0-e039e95b1276')), RunInfo(run_id=UUID('aa4c2a1c-5b08-4fcf-87aa-50228de46db5'))], type='LLMResult')
```

## Streaming the Model output

You can stream the model output.

```python
for chunk in watsonx_llm.stream(
    "Describe your favorite breed of dog and why it is your favorite."
):
    print(chunk, end="")
```

```output
My favorite breed of dog is a Labrador Retriever. They are my favorite breed because they are my favorite color, yellow. They are also very smart and easy to train.
```

## Chaining

Create `PromptTemplate` objects which will be responsible for creating a random question.

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = "Generate a random question about {topic}: Question: "

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```

Provide a topic and run the chain.

```python
llm_chain = prompt | watsonx_llm

topic = "dog"

llm_chain.invoke(topic)
```

```output
'What is the origin of the name "Pomeranian"?'
```
