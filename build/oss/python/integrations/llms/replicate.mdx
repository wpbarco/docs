title: Replicate
---

>[Replicate](https://replicate.com/blog/machine-learning-needs-better-tools) runs machine learning models in the cloud. We have a library of open-source models that you can run with a few lines of code. If you're building your own machine learning models, Replicate makes it easy to deploy them at scale.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Replicate` [models](https://replicate.com/explore)

## Setup

```python
# magics to auto-reload external modules in case you are making changes to langchain while working on this notebook
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
```

To run this notebook, you'll need to create a [replicate](https://replicate.com) account and install the [replicate python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python).

```python
!poetry run pip install replicate
```

## Calling a model

Find a model on the [replicate explore page](https://replicate.com/explore), and then paste in the model name and version in this format: model_name/version.

For example, here is [`Meta Llama 3`](https://replicate.com/meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct).

```python
llm = Replicate(
    model="meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct",
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.75, "max_length": 500, "top_p": 1},
)
prompt = """
User: Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. Can a dog drive a car?
Assistant:
"""
llm(prompt)
```

```output
"Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. A dog is a living being, specifically a mammal.\n2. Dogs do not possess the cognitive abilities or physical characteristics necessary to operate a vehicle, such as a car.\n3. Operating a car requires complex mental and physical abilities, including:\n\t* Understanding of traffic laws and rules\n\t* Ability to read and comprehend road signs\n\t* Ability to make decisions quickly and accurately\n\t* Ability to physically manipulate the vehicle's controls (e.g., steering wheel, pedals)\n4. Dogs do not possess any of these abilities. They are unable to read or comprehend written language, let alone complex traffic laws.\n5. Dogs also lack the physical dexterity and coordination to operate a vehicle's controls. Their paws and claws are not adapted for grasping or manipulating small, precise objects like a steering wheel or pedals.\n6. Therefore, it is not possible for a dog to drive a car.\n\nAnswer: No."
```

As another example, for this [dolly model](https://replicate.com/replicate/dolly-v2-12b), click on the API tab. The model name/version would be: `replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5`

Only the `model` param is required, but we can add other model params when initializing.

For example, if we were running stable diffusion and wanted to change the image dimensions:

```
Replicate(model="stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf", input={'image_dimensions': '512x512'})
```

*Note that only the first output of a model will be returned.*

```python
llm = Replicate(
    model="replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"
)
```

```python
prompt = """
Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step.
Can a dog drive a car?
"""
llm(prompt)
```

```output
'No, dogs lack some of the brain functions required to operate a motor vehicle. They cannot focus and react in time to accelerate or brake correctly. Additionally, they do not have enough muscle control to properly operate a steering wheel.\n\n'
```

We can call any replicate model using this syntax. For example, we can call stable diffusion.

```python
text2image = Replicate(
    model="stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf",
    model_kwargs={"image_dimensions": "512x512"},
)
```

```python
image_output = text2image("A cat riding a motorcycle by Picasso")
image_output
```

```output
'https://pbxt.replicate.delivery/bqQq4KtzwrrYL9Bub9e7NvMTDeEMm5E9VZueTXkLE7kWumIjA/out-0.png'
```

The model spits out a URL. Let's render it.

```python
!poetry run pip install Pillow
```

```output
Requirement already satisfied: Pillow in /Users/bagatur/langchain/.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (9.5.0)

[notice] A new release of pip is available: 23.2 -> 23.2.1
[notice] To update, run: pip install -U pip
```

```python
from io import BytesIO

import requests
from PIL import Image

response = requests.get(image_output)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

img
```

## Streaming Response

You can optionally stream the response as it is produced, which is helpful to show interactivity to users for time-consuming generations. See detailed docs on [Streaming](/oss/python/langchain/streaming) for more information.

```python
from langchain_core.callbacks import StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler

llm = Replicate(
    streaming=True,
    callbacks=[StreamingStdOutCallbackHandler()],
    model="a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5",
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.75, "max_length": 500, "top_p": 1},
)
prompt = """
User: Answer the following yes/no question by reasoning step by step. Can a dog drive a car?
Assistant:
"""
_ = llm.invoke(prompt)
```

```output
1. Dogs do not have the physical ability to operate a vehicle.
```

# Stop Sequences

You can also specify stop sequences. If you have a definite stop sequence for the generation that you are going to parse with anyway, it is better (cheaper and faster!) to just cancel the generation once one or more stop sequences are reached, rather than letting the model ramble on till the specified `max_length`. Stop sequences work regardless of whether you are in streaming mode or not, and Replicate only charges you for the generation up until the stop sequence.

```python
import time

llm = Replicate(
    model="a16z-infra/llama13b-v2-chat:df7690f1994d94e96ad9d568eac121aecf50684a0b0963b25a41cc40061269e5",
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.01, "max_length": 500, "top_p": 1},
)

prompt = """
User: What is the best way to learn python?
Assistant:
"""
start_time = time.perf_counter()
raw_output = llm.invoke(prompt)  # raw output, no stop
end_time = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Raw output:\n {raw_output}")
print(f"Raw output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds")

start_time = time.perf_counter()
stopped_output = llm.invoke(prompt, stop=["\n\n"])  # stop on double newlines
end_time = time.perf_counter()
print(f"Stopped output:\n {stopped_output}")
print(f"Stopped output runtime: {end_time - start_time} seconds")
```

```output
Raw output:

## Chaining Calls

The whole point of langchain is to... chain! Here's an example of how do that.

```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain
```

First, let's define the LLM for this model as a flan-5, and text2image as a stable diffusion model.

```python
dolly_llm = Replicate(
    model="replicate/dolly-v2-12b:ef0e1aefc61f8e096ebe4db6b2bacc297daf2ef6899f0f7e001ec445893500e5"
)
text2image = Replicate(
    model="stability-ai/stable-diffusion:db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf"
)
```

First prompt in the chain

```python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["product"],
    template="What is a good name for a company that makes {product}?",
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=prompt)
```

Second prompt to get the logo for company description

```python
second_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["company_name"],
    template="Write a description of a logo for this company: {company_name}",
)
chain_two = LLMChain(llm=dolly_llm, prompt=second_prompt)
```

Third prompt, let's create the image based on the description output from prompt 2

```python
third_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["company_logo_description"],
    template="{company_logo_description}",
)
chain_three = LLMChain(llm=text2image, prompt=third_prompt)
```

Now let's run it!

```python
# Run the chain specifying only the input variable for the first chain.
overall_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(
    chains=[chain, chain_two, chain_three], verbose=True
)
catchphrase = overall_chain.run("colorful socks")
print(catchphrase)
```

```output
> Entering new SimpleSequentialChain chain...
Colorful socks could be named after a song by The Beatles or a color (yellow, blue, pink). A good combination of letters and digits would be 6399. Apple also owns the domain 6399.com so this could be reserved for the Company.


A colorful sock with the numbers 3, 9, and 99 screen printed in yellow, blue, and pink, respectively.

> Finished chain.
https://pbxt.replicate.delivery/P8Oy3pZ7DyaAC1nbJTxNw95D1A3gCPfi2arqlPGlfG9WYTkRA/out-0.png

```python
response = requests.get(
    "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/682XgeUlFela7kmZgPOf39dDdGDDkwjsCIJ0aQ0AO5bTbbkiA/out-0.png"
)
img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
img
```
