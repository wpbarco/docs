title: Databricks
---

> [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) Lakehouse Platform unifies data, analytics, and AI on one platform.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Databricks [LLM models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/text_llms). For detailed documentation of all features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/llms/langchain_community.llms.databricks.Databricks.html).

## Overview

`Databricks` LLM class wraps a completion endpoint hosted as either of these two endpoint types:

* [Databricks Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html), recommended for production and development,
* Cluster driver proxy app, recommended for interactive development.

This example notebook shows how to wrap your LLM endpoint and use it as an LLM in your LangChain application.

## Limitations

The `Databricks` LLM class is *legacy* implementation and has several limitations in the feature compatibility.

* Only supports synchronous invocation. Streaming or async APIs are not supported.
* `batch` API is not supported.

To use those features, please use the new [ChatDatabricks](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/databricks) class instead. `ChatDatabricks` supports all APIs of `ChatModel` including streaming, async, batch, etc.

## Setup

To access Databricks models you'll need to create a Databricks account, set up credentials (only if you are outside Databricks workspace), and install required packages.

### Credentials (only if you are outside Databricks)

If you are running LangChain app inside Databricks, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, you need manually set the Databricks workspace hostname and personal access token to `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables, respectively. See [Authentication Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/index.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens) for how to get an access token.

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["DATABRICKS_HOST"] = "https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
if "DATABRICKS_TOKEN" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["DATABRICKS_TOKEN"] = getpass.getpass(
        "Enter your Databricks access token: "
    )
```

Alternatively, you can pass those parameters when initializing the `Databricks` class.

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Databricks

databricks = Databricks(
    host="https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com",
    # We strongly recommend NOT to hardcode your access token in your code, instead use secret management tools
    # or environment variables to store your access token securely. The following example uses Databricks Secrets
    # to retrieve the access token that is available within the Databricks notebook.
    token=dbutils.secrets.get(scope="YOUR_SECRET_SCOPE", key="databricks-token"),
)
```

### Installation

The LangChain Databricks integration lives in the `langchain-community` package. Also, `mlflow >= 2.9` is required to run the code in this notebook.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community mlflow>=2.9.0
```

## Wrapping Model Serving Endpoint

### Prerequisites

* An LLM was registered and deployed to [a Databricks serving endpoint](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html).
* You have ["Can Query" permission](https://docs.databricks.com/security/auth-authz/access-control/serving-endpoint-acl.html) to the endpoint.

The expected MLflow model signature is:

* inputs: `[{"name": "prompt", "type": "string"}, {"name": "stop", "type": "list[string]"}]`
* outputs: `[{"type": "string"}]`

### Invocation

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Databricks

llm = Databricks(endpoint_name="YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME")
llm.invoke("How are you?")
```

```output
'I am happy to hear that you are in good health and as always, you are appreciated.'
```

```python
llm.invoke("How are you?", stop=["."])
```

```output
'Good'
```

### Transform Input and Output

Sometimes you may want to wrap a serving endpoint that has imcompatible model signature or you want to insert extra configs. You can use the `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` arguments to define additional pre/post process.

```python
# Use `transform_input_fn` and `transform_output_fn` if the serving endpoint
# expects a different input schema and does not return a JSON string,
# respectively, or you want to apply a prompt template on top.


def transform_input(**request):
    full_prompt = f"""{request["prompt"]}
    Be Concise.
    """
    request["prompt"] = full_prompt
    return request


def transform_output(response):
    return response.upper()


llm = Databricks(
    endpoint_name="YOUR_ENDPOINT_NAME",
    transform_input_fn=transform_input,
    transform_output_fn=transform_output,
)

llm.invoke("How are you?")
```

```output
'I AM DOING GREAT THANK YOU.'
```
