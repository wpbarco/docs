title: ZhipuAIEmbeddings
---

This will help you get started with ZhipuAI embedding models using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `ZhipuAIEmbeddings` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://bigmodel.cn/dev/api#vector).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Provider | Package |
|:--------:|:-------:|
| [ZhipuAI](/oss/python/integrations/providers/zhipuai/) | [langchain-community](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/embeddings/langchain_community.embeddings.zhipuai.ZhipuAIEmbeddings.html) |

## Setup

To access ZhipuAI embedding models you'll need to create a/an ZhipuAI account, get an API key, and install the `zhipuai` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [https://bigmodel.cn/](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/apikeys) to sign up to ZhipuAI and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the ZHIPUAI_API_KEY environment variable:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("ZHIPUAI_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["ZHIPUAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your ZhipuAI API key: ")
```

To enable automated tracing of your model calls, set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
```

### Installation

The LangChain ZhipuAI integration lives in the `zhipuai` package:

```python
pip install -qU zhipuai
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import ZhipuAIEmbeddings

embeddings = ZhipuAIEmbeddings(
    model="embedding-3",
    # With the `embedding-3` class
    # of models, you can specify the size
    # of the embeddings you want returned.
    # dimensions=1024
)
```

## Indexing and Retrieval

Embedding models are often used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) flows, both as part of indexing data as well as later retrieving it. For more detailed instructions, please see our [RAG tutorials](/oss/python/langchain/rag).

Below, see how to index and retrieve data using the `embeddings` object we initialized above. In this example, we will index and retrieve a sample document in the `InMemoryVectorStore`.

```python
# Create a vector store with a sample text
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore

text = "LangChain is the framework for building context-aware reasoning applications"

vectorstore = InMemoryVectorStore.from_texts(
    [text],
    embedding=embeddings,
)

# Use the vectorstore as a retriever
retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()

# Retrieve the most similar text
retrieved_documents = retriever.invoke("What is LangChain?")

# show the retrieved document's content
retrieved_documents[0].page_content
```

```output
'LangChain is the framework for building context-aware reasoning applications'
```

## Direct Usage

Under the hood, the vectorstore and retriever implementations are calling `embeddings.embed_documents(...)` and `embeddings.embed_query(...)` to create embeddings for the text(s) used in `from_texts` and retrieval `invoke` operations, respectively.

You can directly call these methods to get embeddings for your own use cases.

### Embed single texts

You can embed single texts or documents with `embed_query`:

```python
single_vector = embeddings.embed_query(text)
print(str(single_vector)[:100])  # Show the first 100 characters of the vector
```

```output
[-0.022979736, 0.007785797, 0.04598999, 0.012741089, -0.01689148, 0.008277893, 0.016464233, 0.009246
```

### Embed multiple texts

You can embed multiple texts with `embed_documents`:

```python
text2 = (
    "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs"
)
two_vectors = embeddings.embed_documents([text, text2])
for vector in two_vectors:
    print(str(vector)[:100])  # Show the first 100 characters of the vector
```

```output
[-0.022979736, 0.007785797, 0.04598999, 0.012741089, -0.01689148, 0.008277893, 0.016464233, 0.009246
[-0.02330017, -0.013916016, 0.00022411346, 0.017196655, -0.034240723, 0.011131287, 0.011497498, -0.0
```
