This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with Eden AI embedding models

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accessing the EDENAI's API requires an API key,

which you can get by creating an account [app.edenai.run/user/register](https://app.edenai.run/user/register)  and heading here [app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings](https://app.edenai.run/admin/account/settings)

Once we have a key we'll want to set it as an environment variable by running:

```shell
export EDENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

If you'd prefer not to set an environment variable you can pass the key in directly via the edenai_api_key named parameter

 when initiating the EdenAI embedding class:

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings.edenai import EdenAiEmbeddings
```

```python
embeddings = EdenAiEmbeddings(edenai_api_key="...", provider="...")
```

## Calling a model

The EdenAI API brings together various providers.

To access a specific model, you can simply use the "provider" when calling.

```python
embeddings = EdenAiEmbeddings(provider="openai")
```

```python
docs = ["It's raining right now", "cats are cute"]
document_result = embeddings.embed_documents(docs)
```

```python
query = "my umbrella is broken"
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(query)
```

```python
import numpy as np

query_numpy = np.array(query_result)
for doc_res, doc in zip(document_result, docs):
    document_numpy = np.array(doc_res)
    similarity = np.dot(query_numpy, document_numpy) / (
        np.linalg.norm(query_numpy) * np.linalg.norm(document_numpy)
    )
    print(f'Cosine similarity between "{doc}" and query: {similarity}')
```

```output
Cosine similarity between "It's raining right now" and query: 0.849261496107252
Cosine similarity between "cats are cute" and query: 0.7525900655705218
```
