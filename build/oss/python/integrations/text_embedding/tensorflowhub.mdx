>[TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub) is a repository of trained machine learning models ready for fine-tuning and deployable anywhere. Reuse trained models like `BERT` and `Faster R-CNN` with just a few lines of code.

Let's load the TensorflowHub Embedding class.

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import TensorflowHubEmbeddings
```

```python
embeddings = TensorflowHubEmbeddings()
```

```output
2023-01-30 23:53:01.652176: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:193] This TensorFlow binary is optimized with oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) to use the following CPU instructions in performance-critical operations:  AVX2 FMA
To enable them in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

```

```python
text = "This is a test document."
```

```python
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
```

```python
doc_results = embeddings.embed_documents(["foo"])
```

```python
doc_results
```

```python
