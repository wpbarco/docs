title: Sentence Transformers on Hugging Face
---

>[Hugging Face sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings.
>You can use these embedding models from the `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` class.

<Warning>
**Running sentence-transformers locally can be affected by your operating system and other global factors. It is recommended for experienced users only.**

</Warning>

## Setup

You'll need to install the `langchain_huggingface` package as a dependency:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-huggingface
```

## Usage

```python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings

embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

text = "This is a test document."
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)

# show only the first 100 characters of the stringified vector
print(str(query_result)[:100] + "...")
```

```output
[-0.038338568061590195, 0.12346471101045609, -0.028642969205975533, 0.05365273356437683, 0.008845377...
```

```python
doc_result = embeddings.embed_documents([text, "This is not a test document."])
print(str(doc_result)[:100] + "...")
```

```output
[[-0.038338497281074524, 0.12346471846103668, -0.028642890974879265, 0.05365274101495743, 0.00884535...
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with the `accelerate` package not being found or failing to import, installing/upgrading it may help:

```python
pip install -qU accelerate
```
