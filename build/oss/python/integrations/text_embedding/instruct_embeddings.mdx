title: Instruct Embeddings on Hugging Face
---

>[Hugging Face sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings.
>One of the instruct embedding models is used in the `HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings` class.

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings
```

```python
embeddings = HuggingFaceInstructEmbeddings(
    query_instruction="Represent the query for retrieval: "
)
```

```output
load INSTRUCTOR_Transformer
max_seq_length  512
```

```python
text = "This is a test document."
```

```python
query_result = embeddings.embed_query(text)
```

```python

```
