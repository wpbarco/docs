title: HTML to text
---

>[html2text](https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/) is a Python package that converts a page of `HTML` into clean, easy-to-read plain `ASCII text`.

The ASCII also happens to be a valid `Markdown` (a text-to-HTML format).

```python
pip install -qU html2text
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AsyncHtmlLoader

urls = ["https://www.espn.com", "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"]
loader = AsyncHtmlLoader(urls)
docs = loader.load()
```

```output
USER_AGENT environment variable not set, consider setting it to identify your requests.

```python
from langchain_community.document_transformers import Html2TextTransformer

urls = ["https://www.espn.com", "https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/"]
html2text = Html2TextTransformer()
docs_transformed = html2text.transform_documents(docs)

print(docs_transformed[0].page_content[1000:2000])

print(docs_transformed[1].page_content[1000:2000])

## From No. 1 to 100: Ranking the 2024 NBA draft prospects

Who's No. 1? Where do the Kentucky, Duke and UConn players rank? Here's our
final Top 100 Big Board.

  * Full draft order: All 58 picks over two rounds
  * Trade tracker: Details for all deals

  * Betting buzz: Lakers favorites to draft Bronny
  * Use our NBA draft simu
ent system, LLM functions as the agent's brain,
complemented by several key components:

  * **Planning**
    * Subgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.
    * Reflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.
  * **Memory**
    * Short-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.
    * Long-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.
  * **Tool use**
    * The agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including
