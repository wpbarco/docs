```

## Manage vector store

The `SingleStoreVectorStore` assumes that a Document's ID is an integer. Below are examples of how to manage the vector store.

### Add items to vector store

You can add documents to the vector store as follows:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-core
```

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

docs = [
    Document(
        page_content="""In the parched desert, a sudden rainstorm brought relief,
            as the droplets danced upon the thirsty earth, rejuvenating the landscape
            with the sweet scent of petrichor.""",
        metadata={"category": "rain"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="""Amidst the bustling cityscape, the rain fell relentlessly,
            creating a symphony of pitter-patter on the pavement, while umbrellas
            bloomed like colorful flowers in a sea of gray.""",
        metadata={"category": "rain"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="""High in the mountains, the rain transformed into a delicate
            mist, enveloping the peaks in a mystical veil, where each droplet seemed to
            whisper secrets to the ancient rocks below.""",
        metadata={"category": "rain"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="""Blanketing the countryside in a soft, pristine layer, the
            snowfall painted a serene tableau, muffling the world in a tranquil hush
            as delicate flakes settled upon the branches of trees like nature's own
            lacework.""",
        metadata={"category": "snow"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="""In the urban landscape, snow descended, transforming
            bustling streets into a winter wonderland, where the laughter of
            children echoed amidst the flurry of snowballs and the twinkle of
            holiday lights.""",
        metadata={"category": "snow"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="""Atop the rugged peaks, snow fell with an unyielding
            intensity, sculpting the landscape into a pristine alpine paradise,
            where the frozen crystals shimmered under the moonlight, casting a
            spell of enchantment over the wilderness below.""",
        metadata={"category": "snow"},
    ),
]


vector_store.add_documents(docs)
```

### Update items in vector store

To update an existing document in the vector store, use the following code:

```python
updated_document = Document(
    page_content="qux", metadata={"source": "https://another-example.com"}
)

vector_store.update_documents(document_id="1", document=updated_document)
```

### Delete items from vector store

To delete documents from the vector store, use the following code:

```python
vector_store.delete(ids=["3"])
```

## Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search(query="trees in the snow", k=1)
for doc in results:
    print(f"* {doc.page_content} [{doc.metadata}]")
```

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

- TODO: Edit and then run code cell to generate output

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score(query="trees in the snow", k=1)
for doc, score in results:
    print(f"* [SIM={score:3f}] {doc.page_content} [{doc.metadata}]")
```

### Metadata filtering

SingleStoreDB elevates search capabilities by enabling users to enhance and refine search results through prefiltering based on metadata fields. This functionality empowers developers and data analysts to fine-tune queries, ensuring that search results are precisely tailored to their requirements. By filtering search results using specific metadata attributes, users can narrow down the scope of their queries, focusing only on relevant data subsets.

```python
query = "trees branches"
docs = vector_store.similarity_search(
    query, filter={"category": "snow"}
)  # Find documents that correspond to the query and has category "snow"
print(docs[0].page_content)
```

### Vector index

Enhance your search efficiency with SingleStore DB version 8.5 or above by leveraging [ANN vector indexes](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/vector-indexing/). By setting `use_vector_index=True` during vector store object creation, you can activate this feature. Additionally, if your vectors differ in dimensionality from the default OpenAI embedding size of 1536, ensure to specify the `vector_size` parameter accordingly.

### Search strategies

SingleStoreDB presents a diverse range of search strategies, each meticulously crafted to cater to specific use cases and user preferences. The default `VECTOR_ONLY` strategy utilizes vector operations such as `dot_product` or `euclidean_distance` to calculate similarity scores directly between vectors, while `TEXT_ONLY` employs Lucene-based full-text search, particularly advantageous for text-centric applications. For users seeking a balanced approach, `FILTER_BY_TEXT` first refines results based on text similarity before conducting vector comparisons, whereas `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` prioritizes vector similarity, filtering results before assessing text similarity for optimal matches. Notably, both `FILTER_BY_TEXT` and `FILTER_BY_VECTOR` necessitate a full-text index for operation. Additionally, `WEIGHTED_SUM` emerges as a sophisticated strategy, calculating the final similarity score by weighing vector and text similarities, albeit exclusively utilizing dot_product distance calculations and also requiring a full-text index. These versatile strategies empower users to fine-tune searches according to their unique needs, facilitating efficient and precise data retrieval and analysis. Moreover, SingleStoreDB's hybrid approaches, exemplified by `FILTER_BY_TEXT`, `FILTER_BY_VECTOR`, and `WEIGHTED_SUM` strategies, seamlessly blend vector and text-based searches to maximize efficiency and accuracy, ensuring users can fully leverage the platform's capabilities for a wide range of applications.

```python
from langchain_singlestore.vectorstores import DistanceStrategy

docsearch = SingleStoreVectorStore.from_documents(
    docs,
    embeddings,
    distance_strategy=DistanceStrategy.DOT_PRODUCT,  # Use dot product for similarity search
    use_vector_index=True,  # Use vector index for faster search
    use_full_text_search=True,  # Use full text index
)

vectorResults = docsearch.similarity_search(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    k=1,
    search_strategy=SingleStoreVectorStore.SearchStrategy.VECTOR_ONLY,
    filter={"category": "rain"},
)
print(vectorResults[0].page_content)

textResults = docsearch.similarity_search(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    k=1,
    search_strategy=SingleStoreVectorStore.SearchStrategy.TEXT_ONLY,
)
print(textResults[0].page_content)

filteredByTextResults = docsearch.similarity_search(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    k=1,
    search_strategy=SingleStoreVectorStore.SearchStrategy.FILTER_BY_TEXT,
    filter_threshold=0.1,
)
print(filteredByTextResults[0].page_content)

filteredByVectorResults = docsearch.similarity_search(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    k=1,
    search_strategy=SingleStoreVectorStore.SearchStrategy.FILTER_BY_VECTOR,
    filter_threshold=0.1,
)
print(filteredByVectorResults[0].page_content)

weightedSumResults = docsearch.similarity_search(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    k=1,
    search_strategy=SingleStoreVectorStore.SearchStrategy.WEIGHTED_SUM,
    text_weight=0.2,
    vector_weight=0.8,
)
print(weightedSumResults[0].page_content)
```

### Query by turning into retriever

You can also transform the vector store into a retriever for easier usage in your chains.

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 1})
retriever.invoke("trees in the snow")
```

## Multi-modal Example: Leveraging CLIP and OpenClip Embeddings

In the realm of multi-modal data analysis, the integration of diverse information types like images and text has become increasingly crucial. One powerful tool facilitating such integration is [CLIP](https://openai.com/research/clip), a cutting-edge model capable of embedding both images and text into a shared semantic space. By doing so, CLIP enables the retrieval of relevant content across different modalities through similarity search.

To illustrate, let's consider an application scenario where we aim to effectively analyze multi-modal data. In this example, we harness the capabilities of [OpenClip multimodal embeddings](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding/open_clip), which leverage CLIP's framework. With OpenClip, we can seamlessly embed textual descriptions alongside corresponding images, enabling comprehensive analysis and retrieval tasks. Whether it's identifying visually similar images based on textual queries or finding relevant text passages associated with specific visual content, OpenClip empowers users to explore and extract insights from multi-modal data with remarkable efficiency and accuracy.

```python
pip install -U langchain openai lanchain-singlestore langchain-experimental
```

```python
import os

from langchain_experimental.open_clip import OpenCLIPEmbeddings
from langchain_singlestore.vectorstores import SingleStoreVectorStore

os.environ["SINGLESTOREDB_URL"] = "root:pass@localhost:3306/db"

TEST_IMAGES_DIR = "../../modules/images"

docsearch = SingleStoreVectorStore(OpenCLIPEmbeddings())

image_uris = sorted(
    [
        os.path.join(TEST_IMAGES_DIR, image_name)
        for image_name in os.listdir(TEST_IMAGES_DIR)
        if image_name.endswith(".jpg")
    ]
)

# Add images
docsearch.add_images(uris=image_uris)
```
