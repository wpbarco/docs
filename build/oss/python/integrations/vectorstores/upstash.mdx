title: Upstash Vector
---

> [Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/whatisvector) is a serverless vector database designed for working with vector embeddings.
>
> The vector langchain integration is a wrapper around the [upstash-vector](https://github.com/upstash/vector-py) package.
>
> The python package uses the [vector rest api](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/api/get-started) behind the scenes.

## Installation

Create a free vector database from [upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/vector) with the desired dimensions and distance metric.

You can then create an `UpstashVectorStore` instance by:

- Providing the environment variables `UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL` and `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN`

- Giving them as parameters to the constructor

- Passing an Upstash Vector `Index` instance to the constructor

Also, an [`Embeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/embeddings/#langchain_core.embeddings.embeddings.Embeddings) instance is required to turn given texts into embeddings. Here we use `OpenAIEmbeddings` as an example

```python
%pip install langchain-openai langchain langchain-community upstash-vector
```

```python
import os

from langchain_community.vectorstores.upstash import UpstashVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN>"

# Create an embeddings instance
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create a vector store instance
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=embeddings)
```

An alternative way of creating `UpstashVectorStore` is to [create an Upstash Vector index by selecting a model](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels#using-a-model) and passing `embedding=True`. In this configuration, documents or queries will be sent to Upstash as text and embedded there.

```python
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=True)
```

If you are interested in trying out this approach, you can update the initialization of `store` like above and run the rest of the tutorial.

## Load documents

Load an example text file and split it into chunks which can be turned into vector embeddings.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

docs[:3]
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.'),
 Document(metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland. \n\nIn this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight. \n\nLet each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world. \n\nPlease rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people. \n\nThroughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.   \n\nThey keep moving.   \n\nAnd the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.   \n\nThat’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. \n\nThe United States is a member along with 29 other nations. \n\nIt matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.'),
 Document(metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. \n\nHe rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. \n\nHe thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \n\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \n\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \n\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \n\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.')]
```

## Inserting documents

The vectorstore embeds text chunks using the embedding object and batch inserts them into the database. This returns an id array of the inserted vectors.

```python
inserted_vectors = store.add_documents(docs)

inserted_vectors[:5]
```

```output
['247aa3ae-9be9-43e2-98e4-48f94f920749',
 'c4dfc886-0a2d-497c-b2b7-d923a5cb3832',
 '0350761d-ca68-414e-b8db-7eca78cb0d18',
 '902fe5eb-8543-486a-bd5f-79858a7a8af1',
 '28875612-c672-4de4-b40a-3b658c72036a']
```

## Querying

The database can be queried using a vector or a text prompt.
If a text prompt is used, it's first converted into embedding and then queried.

The `k` parameter specifies how many results to return from the query.

```python
result = store.similarity_search("technology", k=5)
result
```

```output

## Querying with score

The score of the query can be included for every result.

> The score returned in the query requests is a normalized value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates the highest similarity and 0 the lowest regardless of the similarity function used. For more information look at the [docs](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/features#vector-similarity-functions).

```python
result = store.similarity_search_with_score("technology", k=5)

for doc, score in result:
    print(f"{doc.metadata} - {score}")
```

```output
{'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'} - 0.8968438

## Namespaces

Namespaces can be used to separate different types of documents. This can increase the efficiency of the queries since the search space is reduced. When no namespace is provided, the default namespace is used.

```python
store_books = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=embeddings, namespace="books")
```

```python
store_books.add_texts(
    [

## Metadata Filtering

Metadata can be used to filter the results of a query. You can refer to the [docs](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/filtering) to see more complex ways of filtering.

```python
result = store_books.similarity_search("dystopia", k=3, filter="year < 2000")
result
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'title': '1984', 'author': 'George Orwell', 'year': 1949}, page_content='A chilling portrayal of a totalitarian regime, this dystopian novel offers a bleak vision of a future world dominated by surveillance, propaganda, and thought control. Through the eyes of a disillusioned protagonist, it explores the dangers of totalitarianism and the erosion of individual freedom in a society ruled by fear and oppression.'),
 Document(metadata={'title': 'Brave New World', 'author': 'Aldous Huxley', 'year': 1932}, page_content='In a society where emotion is suppressed and individuality is forbidden, one man dares to defy the oppressive regime. Through acts of rebellion and forbidden love, he discovers the power of human connection and the importance of free will.'),

```

## Getting info about vector database

You can get information about your database like the distance metric dimension using the info function.

> When an insert happens, the database an indexing takes place. While this is happening new vectors can not be queried. `pendingVectorCount` represents the number of vector that are currently being indexed.

```python
store.info()
```

```output
InfoResult(vector_count=49, pending_vector_count=0, index_size=2978163, dimension=1536, similarity_function='COSINE', namespaces={'': NamespaceInfo(vector_count=42, pending_vector_count=0), 'books': NamespaceInfo(vector_count=7, pending_vector_count=0)})
```

## Deleting vectors

Vectors can be deleted by their ids

```python
store.delete(inserted_vectors)
```

## Clearing the vector database

This will clear the vector database

```python
store.delete(delete_all=True)
store_books.delete(delete_all=True)
```
