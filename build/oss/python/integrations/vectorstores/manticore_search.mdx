title: ManticoreSearch VectorStore
---

[ManticoreSearch](https://manticoresearch.com/) is an open-source search engine that offers fast, scalable, and user-friendly capabilities. Originating as a fork of [Sphinx Search](http://sphinxsearch.com/), it has evolved to incorporate modern search engine features and improvements. ManticoreSearch distinguishes itself with its robust performance and ease of integration into various applications.

ManticoreSearch has recently introduced [vector search capabilities](https://manual.manticoresearch.com/dev/Searching/KNN), starting with search engine version 6.2 and only with [manticore-columnar-lib](https://github.com/manticoresoftware/columnar) package installed. This feature is a considerable advancement, allowing for the execution of searches based on vector similarity.

As of now, the vector search functionality is only accessible in the developmental (dev) versions of the search engine. Consequently, it is imperative to employ a developmental [manticoresearch-dev](https://pypi.org/project/manticoresearch-dev/) Python client for utilizing this feature effectively.

## Setting up environments

Starting Docker-container with ManticoreSearch and installing manticore-columnar-lib package (optional)

```python
import time

# Start container
containers = !docker ps --filter "name=langchain-manticoresearch-server" -q
if len(containers) == 0:
    !docker run -d -p 9308:9308 --name langchain-manticoresearch-server manticoresearch/manticore:dev
    time.sleep(20)  # Wait for the container to start up

# Get ID of container
container_id = containers[0]

# Install manticore-columnar-lib package as root user
!docker exec -it --user 0 {container_id} apt-get update
!docker exec -it --user 0 {container_id} apt-get install -y manticore-columnar-lib

# Restart container
!docker restart {container_id}
```

Installing ManticoreSearch python client

```python
pip install -qU manticoresearch-dev
```

```output
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 23.2.1 -> 24.0
[notice] To update, run: pip install -U pip
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

We want to use [`OpenAIEmbeddings`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/OpenAIEmbeddings/) so we have to get the OpenAI API Key.

```python
from langchain_community.embeddings import GPT4AllEmbeddings
from langchain_community.vectorstores import ManticoreSearch, ManticoreSearchSettings
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader

loader = TextLoader("../../modules/paul_graham_essay.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=100, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

embeddings = GPT4AllEmbeddings()
```
