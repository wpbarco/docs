title: acreom

[acreom](https://acreom.com) is a dev-first knowledge base with tasks running on local markdown files.

Below is an example on how to load a local acreom vault into LangChain. As the local vault in acreom is a folder of plain text .md files, the loader requires the path to the directory.

Vault files may contain some metadata which is stored as a YAML header. These values will be added to the documentâ€™s metadata if `collect_metadata` is set to true.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AcreomLoader
```

```python
loader = AcreomLoader("<path-to-acreom-vault>", collect_metadata=False)
```

```python
docs = loader.load()
```
