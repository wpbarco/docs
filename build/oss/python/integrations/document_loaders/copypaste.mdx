title: Copy Paste
---

This notebook covers how to load a document object from something you just want to copy and paste. In this case, you don't even need to use a DocumentLoader, but rather can just construct the Document directly.

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document
```

```python
text = "..... put the text you copy pasted here......"
```

```python
doc = Document(page_content=text)
```

## Metadata

If you want to add metadata about the where you got this piece of text, you easily can with the metadata key.

```python
metadata = {"source": "internet", "date": "Friday"}
```

```python
doc = Document(page_content=text, metadata=metadata)
```

```python

```
