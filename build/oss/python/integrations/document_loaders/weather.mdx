>[OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) is an open-source weather service provider

This loader fetches the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap's OneCall API, using the pyowm Python package. You must initialize the loader with your OpenWeatherMap API token and the names of the cities you want the weather data for.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WeatherDataLoader
```

```python
pip install -qU  pyowm
```

```python
# Set API key either by passing it in to constructor directly
# or by setting the environment variable "OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY".

from getpass import getpass

OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY = getpass()
```

```python
loader = WeatherDataLoader.from_params(
    ["chennai", "vellore"], openweathermap_api_key=OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY
)
```

```python
documents = loader.load()
documents
```
