title: Outline Document Loader
---

>[Outline](https://www.getoutline.com/) is an open-source collaborative knowledge base platform designed for team information sharing.

This notebook shows how to obtain langchain Documents from your Outline collections.

## Overview

The [Outline Document Loader](https://github.com/10Pines/langchain-outline) can be used to load Outline collections as LangChain Documents for integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.

This example demonstrates:

* Setting up a Document Loader to load all documents from an Outline instance.

### Setup

Before starting, ensure you have the following environment variables set:

* OUTLINE_API_KEY: Your API key for authenticating with your Outline instance ([www.getoutline.com/developers#section/Authentication](https://www.getoutline.com/developers#section/Authentication)).
* OUTLINE_INSTANCE_URL: The URL (including protocol) of your Outline instance.

```python
import os

os.environ["OUTLINE_API_KEY"] = "ol_api_xyz123"
os.environ["OUTLINE_INSTANCE_URL"] = "https://app.getoutline.com"
```

## Initialization

To initialize the OutlineLoader, you need the following parameters:

* outline_base_url: The URL of your outline instance (or it will be taken from the environment variable).
* outline_api_key: Your API key for authenticating with your Outline instance (or it will be taken from the environment variable).
* outline_collection_id_list: List of collection ids to be retrieved. If None all will be retrieved.
* page_size: Because the Outline API uses paginated results you can configure how many results (documents) per page will be retrieved per API request.  If this is not specified a default will be used.

## Instantiation

```python
# Option 1: Using environment variables (ensure they are set)
from langchain_outline.document_loaders.outline import OutlineLoader

loader = OutlineLoader()

# Option 2: Passing parameters directly
loader = OutlineLoader(
    outline_base_url="YOUR_OUTLINE_URL", outline_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)
```

## Load

To load and return all documents available in the Outline instance

```python
loader.load()
```

## Lazy Load

The lazy_load method allows you to iteratively load documents from the Outline collection, yielding each document as it is fetched:

```python
loader.lazy_load()
```
