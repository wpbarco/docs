title: Needle Document Loader
---

[Needle](https://needle-ai.com) makes it easy to create your RAG pipelines with minimal effort.

For more details, refer to our [API documentation](https://docs.needle-ai.com/docs/api-reference/needle-api)

## Overview

The Needle Document Loader is a utility for integrating Needle collections with LangChain. It enables seamless storage, retrieval, and utilization of documents for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.

This example demonstrates:

* Storing documents into a Needle collection.
* Setting up a retriever to fetch documents.
* Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

### Setup

Before starting, ensure you have the following environment variables set:

* NEEDLE_API_KEY: Your API key for authenticating with Needle.
* OPENAI_API_KEY: Your OpenAI API key for language model operations.

```python
import os
```

```python
os.environ["NEEDLE_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Initialization

To initialize the NeedleLoader, you need the following parameters:

* needle_api_key: Your Needle API key (or set it as an environment variable).
* collection_id: The ID of the Needle collection to work with.

## Instantiation

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.needle import NeedleLoader

collection_id = "clt_01J87M9T6B71DHZTHNXYZQRG5H"

# Initialize NeedleLoader to store documents to the collection
document_loader = NeedleLoader(
    needle_api_key=os.getenv("NEEDLE_API_KEY"),
    collection_id=collection_id,
)
```

## Load

To add files to the Needle collection:

```python
files = {
    "tech-radar-30.pdf": "https://www.thoughtworks.com/content/dam/thoughtworks/documents/radar/2024/04/tr_technology_radar_vol_30_en.pdf"
}

document_loader.add_files(files=files)
```

```python
# Show the documents in the collection
# collections_documents = document_loader.load()
```

## Lazy Load

The lazy_load method allows you to iteratively load documents from the Needle collection, yielding each document as it is fetched:

```python
# Show the documents in the collection
# collections_documents = document_loader.lazy_load()
```

## Usage

### Use within a chain

Below is a complete example of setting up a RAG pipeline with Needle within a chain:

```python
import os

from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
from langchain_community.retrievers.needle import NeedleRetriever
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# Initialize the Needle retriever (make sure your Needle API key is set as an environment variable)
retriever = NeedleRetriever(
    needle_api_key=os.getenv("NEEDLE_API_KEY"),
    collection_id="clt_01J87M9T6B71DHZTHNXYZQRG5H",
)

# Define system prompt for the assistant
system_prompt = """
    You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
    Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer the question.
    If you don't know, say so concisely.\n\n{context}
    """

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [("system", system_prompt), ("human", "{input}")]
)

# Define the question-answering chain using a document chain (stuff chain) and the retriever
question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)

# Create the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain by combining the retriever and the question-answering chain
rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)

# Define the input query
query = {"input": "Did RAG move to accepted?"}

response = rag_chain.invoke(query)

response
```

```output
