title: YouTube audio
---

Building chat or QA applications on YouTube videos is a topic of high interest.

Below we show how to easily go from a `YouTube url` to `audio of the video` to `text` to `chat`!

We wil use the `OpenAIWhisperParser`, which will use the OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe audio to text,
and the  `OpenAIWhisperParserLocal` for local support and running on private clouds or on premise.

Note: You will need to have an `OPENAI_API_KEY` supplied.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.blob_loaders.youtube_audio import (
    YoutubeAudioLoader,
)
from langchain_community.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders.parsers.audio import (
    OpenAIWhisperParser,
    OpenAIWhisperParserLocal,
)
```

We will use `yt_dlp` to download audio for YouTube urls.

We will use `pydub` to split downloaded audio files (such that we adhere to Whisper API's 25MB file size limit).

```python
pip install -qU  yt_dlp
pip install -qU  pydub
pip install -qU  librosa
```

### YouTube url to text

Use `YoutubeAudioLoader` to fetch / download the audio files.

Then, ues `OpenAIWhisperParser()` to transcribe them to text.

Let's take the first lecture of Andrej Karpathy's YouTube course as an example!

```python
# set a flag to switch between local and remote parsing
# change this to True if you want to use local parsing
local = False
```

```python
# Two Karpathy lecture videos
urls = ["https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY", "https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0"]

# Directory to save audio files
save_dir = "~/Downloads/YouTube"

# Transcribe the videos to text
if local:
    loader = GenericLoader(
        YoutubeAudioLoader(urls, save_dir), OpenAIWhisperParserLocal()
    )
else:
    loader = GenericLoader(YoutubeAudioLoader(urls, save_dir), OpenAIWhisperParser())
docs = loader.load()
```

So in particular we are going to start with a blank Jupyter notebook and by the end of this lecture we will define and train a neural net and you'll get to see everything that goes on under the hood and exactly sort of how that works on an intuitive level.

### Building a chat app from YouTube video

Given `Documents`, we can easily enable chat / question+answering.

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
```

```python
# Combine doc
combined_docs = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]
text = " ".join(combined_docs)
```

```python
# Split them
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1500, chunk_overlap=150)
splits = text_splitter.split_text(text)
```

```python
# Build an index
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = FAISS.from_texts(splits, embeddings)
```

```python
# Build a QA chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=vectordb.as_retriever(),
)
```

```python
# Ask a question!
query = "Why do we need to zero out the gradient before backprop at each step?"
qa_chain.run(query)
```

```output
"We need to zero out the gradient before backprop at each step because the backward pass accumulates gradients in the grad attribute of each parameter. If we don't reset the grad to zero before each backward pass, the gradients will accumulate and add up, leading to incorrect updates and slower convergence. By resetting the grad to zero before each backward pass, we ensure that the gradients are calculated correctly and that the optimization process works as intended."
```

```python
query = "What is the difference between an encoder and decoder?"
qa_chain.run(query)
```

```output
'In the context of transformers, an encoder is a component that reads in a sequence of input tokens and generates a sequence of hidden representations. On the other hand, a decoder is a component that takes in a sequence of hidden representations and generates a sequence of output tokens. The main difference between the two is that the encoder is used to encode the input sequence into a fixed-length representation, while the decoder is used to decode the fixed-length representation into an output sequence. In machine translation, for example, the encoder reads in the source language sentence and generates a fixed-length representation, which is then used by the decoder to generate the target language sentence.'
```

```python
query = "For any token, what are x, k, v, and q?"
qa_chain.run(query)
```

```output
'For any token, x is the input vector that contains the private information of that token, k and q are the key and query vectors respectively, which are produced by forwarding linear modules on x, and v is the vector that is calculated by propagating the same linear module on x again. The key vector represents what the token contains, and the query vector represents what the token is looking for. The vector v is the information that the token will communicate to other tokens if it finds them interesting, and it gets aggregated for the purposes of the self-attention mechanism.'
