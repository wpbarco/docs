title: TOML
---

>[TOML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML) is a file format for configuration files. It is intended to be easy to read and write, and is designed to map unambiguously to a dictionary. Its specification is open-source. `TOML` is implemented in many programming languages. The name `TOML` is an acronym for "Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language" referring to its creator, Tom Preston-Werner.

If you need to load `Toml` files, use the `TomlLoader`.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TomlLoader
```

```python
loader = TomlLoader("example_data/fake_rule.toml")
```

```python
rule = loader.load()
```

```python
rule
```

```output
