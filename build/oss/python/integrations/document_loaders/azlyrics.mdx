>[AZLyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/) is a large, legal, every day growing collection of lyrics.

This covers how to load AZLyrics webpages into a document format that we can use downstream.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import AZLyricsLoader
```

```python
loader = AZLyricsLoader("https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/mileycyrus/flowers.html")
```

```python
data = loader.load()
```

```python
data
```

```output
