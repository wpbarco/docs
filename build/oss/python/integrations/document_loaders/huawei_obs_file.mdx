title: Huawei OBS File
---

The following code demonstrates how to load an object from the Huawei OBS (Object Storage Service) as document.

```python
# Install the required package
# pip install esdk-obs-python
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.obs_file import OBSFileLoader
```

```python
endpoint = "your-endpoint"
```

```python
from obs import ObsClient

obs_client = ObsClient(
    access_key_id="your-access-key",
    secret_access_key="your-secret-key",
    server=endpoint,
)
loader = OBSFileLoader("your-bucket-name", "your-object-key", client=obs_client)
```

```python
loader.load()
```

## Each Loader with Separate Authentication Information

If you don't need to reuse OBS connections between different loaders, you can directly configure the `config`. The loader will use the config information to initialize its own OBS client.

```python
# Configure your access credentials\n
config = {"ak": "your-access-key", "sk": "your-secret-key"}
loader = OBSFileLoader(
    "your-bucket-name", "your-object-key", endpoint=endpoint, config=config
)
```

```python
loader.load()
```

## Get Authentication Information from ECS

If your langchain is deployed on Huawei Cloud ECS and [Agency is set up](https://support.huaweicloud.com/intl/en-us/usermanual-ecs/ecs_03_0166.html#section7), the loader can directly get the security token from ECS without needing access key and secret key.

```python
config = {"get_token_from_ecs": True}
loader = OBSFileLoader(
    "your-bucket-name", "your-object-key", endpoint=endpoint, config=config
)
```

```python
loader.load()
```

## Access a Publicly Accessible Object

If the object you want to access allows anonymous user access (anonymous users have `GetObject` permission), you can directly load the object without configuring the `config` parameter.

```python
loader = OBSFileLoader("your-bucket-name", "your-object-key", endpoint=endpoint)
```

```python
loader.load()
```
