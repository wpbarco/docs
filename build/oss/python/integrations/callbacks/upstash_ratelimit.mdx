title: Upstash Ratelimit Callback
---

In this guide, we will go over how to add rate limiting based on number of requests or the number of tokens using `UpstashRatelimitHandler`. This handler uses [ratelimit library of Upstash](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit-py/), which utilizes [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted).

Upstash Ratelimit works by sending an HTTP request to Upstash Redis everytime the `limit` method is called. Remaining tokens/requests of the user are checked and updated. Based on the remaining tokens, we can stop the execution of costly operations like invoking an LLM or querying a vector store:

```py
response = ratelimit.limit()
if response.allowed:
    execute_costly_operation()
```

`UpstashRatelimitHandler` allows you to incorporate the ratelimit logic into your chain in a few minutes.

First, you will need to go to [the Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/login) and create a redis database ([see our docs](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted)). After creating a database, you will need to set the environment variables:

```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL="****"
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN="****"
```

Next, you will need to install Upstash Ratelimit and Redis library with:

```
pip install upstash-ratelimit upstash-redis
```

You are now ready to add rate limiting to your chain!

## Ratelimiting Per Request

Let's imagine that we want to allow our users to invoke our chain 10 times per minute. Achieving this is as simple as:

```python
# set env variables
import os

os.environ["UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"] = "****"
os.environ["UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN"] = "****"

from langchain_community.callbacks import UpstashRatelimitError, UpstashRatelimitHandler
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from upstash_ratelimit import FixedWindow, Ratelimit
from upstash_redis import Redis

# create ratelimit
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
    redis=Redis.from_env(),
    # 10 requests per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
    limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=10, window=60),
)

# create handler
user_id = "user_id"  # should be a method which gets the user id
handler = UpstashRatelimitHandler(identifier=user_id, request_ratelimit=ratelimit)

# create mock chain
chain = RunnableLambda(str)

# invoke chain with handler:
try:
    result = chain.invoke("Hello world!", config={"callbacks": [handler]})
except UpstashRatelimitError:
    print("Handling ratelimit.", UpstashRatelimitError)
```

```output
Error in UpstashRatelimitHandler.on_chain_start callback: UpstashRatelimitError('Request limit reached!')
```
```output
Handling ratelimit. <class 'langchain_community.callbacks.upstash_ratelimit_callback.UpstashRatelimitError'>
```

Note that we pass the handler to the `invoke` method instead of passing the handler when defining the chain.

For rate limiting algorithms other than `FixedWindow`, see [upstash-ratelimit docs](https://github.com/upstash/ratelimit-py?tab=readme-ov-file#ratelimiting-algorithms).

Before executing any steps in our pipeline, ratelimit will check whether the user has passed the request limit. If so, `UpstashRatelimitError` is raised.

## Ratelimiting Per Token

Another option is to rate limit chain invokations based on:

1. number of tokens in prompt
2. number of tokens in prompt and LLM completion

This only works if you have an LLM in your chain. Another requirement is that the LLM you are using should return the token usage in it's `LLMOutput`.

### How it works

The handler will get the remaining tokens before calling the LLM. If the remaining tokens is more than 0, LLM will be called. Otherwise `UpstashRatelimitError` will be raised.

After LLM is called, token usage information will be used to subtracted from the remaining tokens of the user. No error is raised at this stage of the chain.

### Configuration

For the first configuration, simply initialize the handler like this:

```python
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
        redis=Redis.from_env(),
    # 1000 tokens per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
        limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=1000, window=60),
)

handler = UpstashRatelimitHandler(identifier=user_id, token_ratelimit=ratelimit)
```

For the second configuration, here is how to initialize the handler:

```python
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
        redis=Redis.from_env(),
    # 1000 tokens per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
        limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=1000, window=60),
)

handler = UpstashRatelimitHandler(
        identifier=user_id,
        token_ratelimit=ratelimit,
        include_output_tokens=True,  # set to True
)
```

You can also employ ratelimiting based on requests and tokens at the same time, simply by passing both `request_ratelimit` and `token_ratelimit` parameters.

Here is an example with a chain utilizing an LLM:

```python
# set env variables
import os

os.environ["UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL"] = "****"
os.environ["UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN"] = "****"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "****"

from langchain_community.callbacks import UpstashRatelimitError, UpstashRatelimitHandler
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from upstash_ratelimit import FixedWindow, Ratelimit
from upstash_redis import Redis

# create ratelimit
ratelimit = Ratelimit(
        redis=Redis.from_env(),
    # 500 tokens per window, where window size is 60 seconds:
        limiter=FixedWindow(max_requests=500, window=60),
)

# create handler
user_id = "user_id"  # should be a method which gets the user id
handler = UpstashRatelimitHandler(identifier=user_id, token_ratelimit=ratelimit)

# create mock chain
as_str = RunnableLambda(str)
model = ChatOpenAI()

chain = as_str | model

# invoke chain with handler:
try:
        result = chain.invoke("Hello world!", config={"callbacks": [handler]})
except UpstashRatelimitError:
    print("Handling ratelimit.", UpstashRatelimitError)
```

```output
Error in UpstashRatelimitHandler.on_llm_start callback: UpstashRatelimitError('Token limit reached!')
```
```output
Handling ratelimit. <class 'langchain_community.callbacks.upstash_ratelimit_callback.UpstashRatelimitError'>
```
