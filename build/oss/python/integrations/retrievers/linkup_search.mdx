title: LinkupSearchRetriever
---

> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/) provides an API to connect LLMs to the web and the Linkup Premium Partner sources.

This will help you get started with the LinkupSearchRetriever [retriever](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval/). For detailed documentation of all LinkupSearchRetriever features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html).

### Integration details

| Retriever | Source | Package |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
[LinkupSearchRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html) | Web and partner sources | langchain-linkup |

## Setup

To use the Linkup provider, you need a valid API key, which you can find by signing-up [here](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up). You can then set it up as the `LINKUP_API_KEY` environment variable. For the chain example below, you also need to set an OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, which you can also do here:

```python
# import os
# os.environ["LINKUP_API_KEY"] = ""  # Fill with your API key
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""  # Fill with your API key
```

If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

This retriever lives in the `langchain-linkup` package:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-linkup
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our retriever:

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```

## Usage

```python
query = "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"

retriever.invoke(query)
```
