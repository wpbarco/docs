>[Tavily's Search API](https://tavily.com) is a search engine built specifically for AI agents (LLMs), delivering real-time, accurate, and factual results at speed.

We can use this as a [retriever](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval). It will show functionality specific to this integration. After going through, it may be useful to explore [relevant use-case pages](/oss/python/langchain/rag) to learn how to use this vectorstore as part of a larger chain.

### Integration details

<ItemTable category="external_retrievers" item="TavilySearchAPIRetriever" />

## Setup

If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

The integration lives in the `langchain-community` package. We also need to install the `tavily-python` package itself.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community tavily-python
```

We also need to set our Tavily API key.

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our retriever:

```python
from langchain_community.retrievers import TavilySearchAPIRetriever

retriever = TavilySearchAPIRetriever(k=3)
```

## Usage

```python
query = "what year was breath of the wild released?"

retriever.invoke(query)
```

```output

## Use within a chain

We can easily combine this retriever in to a chain.

```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(
    """Answer the question based only on the context provided.

Context: {context}

Question: {question}"""
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")


def format_docs(docs):
    return "\n\n".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)


chain = (
    {"context": retriever | format_docs, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

```python
chain.invoke("how many units did bretch of the wild sell in 2020")
```

```output
'As of August 2020, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild had sold over 20.1 million copies worldwide on Nintendo Switch and Wii U.'
```
