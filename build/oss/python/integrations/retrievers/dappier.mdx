# DappierRetriever

This will help you get started with the Dappier [retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/retrievers/). For detailed documentation of all DappierRetriever features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/retrievers/langchain_dappier.retrievers.Dappier.DappierRetriever.html).

### Setup

Install `langchain-dappier` and set environment variable `DAPPIER_API_KEY`.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-dappier
export DAPPIER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

We also need to set our Dappier API credentials, which can be generated at the [Dappier site.](https://platform.dappier.com/profile/api-keys).

We can find the supported data models by heading over to the [Dappier marketplace.](https://platform.dappier.com/marketplace)

If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```
