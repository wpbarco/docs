These pages detail the core interfaces you will use when building with LangGraph. Each section covers a different part of the ecosystem.

## LangGraph

The core APIs for the LangGraph open source library.

- [Graphs](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/graphs/): Main graph abstraction and usage.
- [Functional API](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/func/): Functional programming interface for graphs.
- [Pregel](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/pregel/): Pregel-inspired computation model.
- [Checkpointers](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/checkpoints/): Saving and restoring graph state.
- [Storage](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/store/): Storage backends and options.
- [Caching](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/cache/): Caching mechanisms for performance.
- [Types](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/types/): Type definitions for graph components.
- [Config](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/config/): Configuration options.
- [Errors](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/errors/): Error types and handling.
- [Constants](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/constants/): Global constants.
- [Channels](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/channels/): Message passing and channels.




## Prebuilt components

Higher-level abstractions for common workflows, agents, and other patterns.

- [Agents](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/agents/): Built-in agent patterns.
- [Supervisor](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/supervisor/): Orchestration and delegation.
- [Swarm](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/swarm/): Multi-agent collaboration.
- [MCP adapters](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/mcp/): Integrations with external systems.
