This error is raised in the prebuilt [create_agent](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/agents/#langchain.agents.create_agent) when the `call_model` graph node receives a malformed list of messages. Specifically, it is malformed when there are `AIMessages` with `tool_calls` (LLM requesting to call a tool) that do not have a corresponding [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) (result of a tool invocation to return to the LLM).




There could be a few reasons you're seeing this error:

1. You manually passed a malformed list of messages when invoking the graph, e.g. `graph.invoke({'messages': [AIMessage(..., tool_calls=[...])]})`
2. The graph was interrupted before receiving updates from the `tools` node (i.e. a list of [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage))
  and you invoked it with an input that is not None or a ToolMessage,
  e.g. `graph.invoke({'messages': [HumanMessage(...)]}, config)`.
  This interrupt could have been triggered in one of the following ways:
    * You manually set `interrupt_before = ['tools']` in `create_agent`
  * One of the tools raised an error that wasn't handled by the [ToolNode](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langgraph/agents/#langgraph.prebuilt.tool_node.ToolNode) (`"tools"`)




## Troubleshooting

To resolve this, you can do one of the following:

1. Don't invoke the graph with a malformed list of messages
2. In case of an interrupt (manual or due to an error) you can:

* provide [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) objects that match existing tool calls and call `graph.invoke({'messages': [ToolMessage(...)]})`.
  **NOTE**: this will append the messages to the history and run the graph from the START node.
  * manually update the state and resume the graph from the interrupt:
    1. get the list of most recent messages from the graph state with `graph.get_state(config)`
    2. modify the list of messages to either remove unanswered tool calls from AIMessages

or add [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) objects with `tool_call_ids` that match unanswered tool calls 3. call `graph.update_state(config, {'messages': ...})` with the modified list of messages 4. resume the graph, e.g. call `graph.invoke(None, config)`
