Your LangGraph [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) reached the maximum number of steps before hitting a stop condition.
This is often due to an infinite loop caused by code like the example below:

```python
class State(TypedDict):
    some_key: str

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("a", ...)
builder.add_node("b", ...)
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
...

graph = builder.compile()
```




However, complex graphs may hit the default limit naturally.

## Troubleshooting

* If you are not expecting your graph to go through many iterations, you likely have a cycle. Check your logic for infinite loops.

* If you have a complex graph, you can pass in a higher `recursion_limit` value into your `config` object when invoking your graph like this:

```python
graph.invoke({...}, {"recursion_limit": 100})
```
