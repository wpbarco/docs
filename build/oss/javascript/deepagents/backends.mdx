title: Backends
description: Choose and configure filesystem backends for deep agents. You can specify routes to different backends, implement virtual filesystems, and enforce policies.
---

Deep agents expose a filesystem surface to the agent via tools like `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, and `grep`. These tools operate through a pluggable backend. This page explains how to choose a backend, route different paths to different backends, implement your own virtual filesystem (for example, S3 or Postgres), add policy hooks, and comply with the backend protocol.

## Quick start

Here are a few pre-built filesystem backends that you can quickly use with your deep agent.

- **Default (ephemeral in state)**

    `agent = create_deep_agent()`

    The default filesystem backend for an agent is stored in langgraph state. Note that this filesystem only persists _for a single thread_.
- **Local filesystem persistence**

    `agent = create_deep_agent(backend=FilesystemBackend(root_dir="."))`

    This gives the deep agent access to your local machine's filesystem. You can specify the root directory that the agent has access to.
- **Durable store (LangGraph Store)**

    `agent = create_deep_agent(backend=lambda rt: StoreBackend(rt))`

    This gives the agent access to long-term storage that is _persisted across threads_. This is great for storing longer term memories or instructions that are applicable to the agent over multiple executions.
- **Composite (ephemeral by default, `/memories/` persisted)**

    The Composite backend is maximally flexible. You can specify different routes in the filesystem to point towards different backends. See Composite routing below for a ready‑to‑paste example.

## Built‑in backends

### StateBackend (ephemeral)
```python
# By default we provide a StateBackend
agent = create_deep_agent()

# Under the hood, it looks like
from deepagents.backends import StateBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=(lambda rt: StateBackend(rt))   # Note that the tools access State through the runtime.state
)
```
**How it works:**
- Stores files in LangGraph agent state for the current thread.
- Persists across multiple agent turns on the same thread via checkpoints.

**Best for:**
- A scratch pad for the agent to write intermediate results.
- Aautomatic eviction of large tool outputs which the agent can then read back in piece by piece.

### FilesystemBackend (local disk)

```python
from deepagents.backends import FilesystemBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=FilesystemBackend(root_dir=".")
)
```
**How it works:**
- Reads/writes real files under a configurable `root_dir`.
- You can optionally set `virtual_mode=True` to sandbox and normalize paths under `root_dir`.
- Uses secure path resolution, prevents unsafe symlink traversal when possible, can use ripgrep for fast `grep`.

**Best for:**
- Local projects on your machine
- CI sandboxes
- Mounted persistent volumes

### StoreBackend (LangGraph Store)
```python
from deepagents.backends import StoreBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    backend=(lambda rt: StoreBackend(rt))   # Note that the tools access Store through the runtime.store
)
```
**How it works:**
- Stores files in a LangGraph `BaseStore` provided by the runtime, enabling cross‑thread durable storage.

**Best for:**
- When you already run with a configured LangGraph store (for example, Redis, Postgres, or cloud implementations behind `BaseStore`).
- When you're deploying your agent through LangSmith Deployments (a store is automatically provisioned for your agent).


### CompositeBackend (router)

```python
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import FilesystemBackend
from deepagents.backends.composite import build_composite_state_backend

composite_backend = lambda rt: CompositeBackend(
    default=StateBackend(rt)
    routes={
        "/memories/": StoreBackend(rt),
        "/docs/": CustomBackend()
    }
)

agent = create_deep_agent(backend=composite_backend)
```
**How it works:**
- Routes file operations to different backends based on path prefix.
- Preserves the original path prefixes in listings and search results.

**Best for:**
- When you want to give your agent both ephemeral and cross-thread storage, a CompositeBackend allows you provide both a StateBackend and StoreBackend
- When you have multiple sources of information that you want to provide to your agent as part of a single filesystem.
    - e.g. You have long-term memories stored under /memories/ in one Store and you also have a custom backend that has documentation accessible at /docs/.

## Specify a backend

- Pass a backend to `create_deep_agent(backend=...)`. The filesystem middleware uses it for all tooling.
- You can pass either:
  - An instance implementing `BackendProtocol` (for example, `FilesystemBackend(root_dir=".")`), or
  - A factory `BackendFactory = Callable[[ToolRuntime], BackendProtocol]` (for backends that need runtime like `StateBackend` or `StoreBackend`).
- If omitted, the default is `lambda rt: StateBackend(rt)`.


## Composite routing example

Route parts of the namespace to different backends. Commonly used to persist `/memories/*` and keep everything else ephemeral.



Behavior:
- `/workspace/plan.md` → StateBackend (ephemeral)
- `/memories/agent.md` → FilesystemBackend under `~/.deepagents/myagent`
- `ls`, `glob`, `grep` aggregate results and show original path prefixes.

Notes:
- Longer prefixes win (for example, route `"/memories/projects/"` can override `"/memories/"`).
- For StoreBackend routing, ensure the agent runtime provides a store (`runtime.store`).

## Virtual filesystem: S3, Postgres, …

Build a custom backend to project a remote or database filesystem into the tools namespace.

Design guidelines:
- Paths are absolute (`/x/y.txt`). Decide how to map them to your storage keys/rows.
- Implement `ls_info` and `glob_info` efficiently (server‑side listing where available, otherwise local filter).
- Return user‑readable error strings for missing files or invalid regex patterns.
- For external persistence, set `files_update=None` in results; only in‑state backends should return a `files_update` dict.

S3‑style skeleton:



Postgres‑style outline:
- Table `files(path text primary key, content text, created_at timestamptz, modified_at timestamptz)`
- Map tool operations onto SQL:
  - `ls_info` uses `WHERE path LIKE $1 || '%'`
  - `glob_info` filter in SQL or fetch then apply glob in Python
  - `grep_raw` can fetch candidate rows by extension or last modified time, then scan lines

## Hooks and policy enforcement

Enforce enterprise rules by subclassing or wrapping a backend.

Block writes/edits under selected prefixes (subclass):



Generic wrapper (works with any backend):



## Protocol reference

Backends must implement the `BackendProtocol`.

Required endpoints:
- `ls_info(path: str) -> list[FileInfo]`
  - Return entries with at least `path`. Include `is_dir`, `size`, `modified_at` when available. Sort by `path` for deterministic output.
- `read(file_path: str, offset: int = 0, limit: int = 2000) -> str`
  - Return numbered content. On missing file, return `"Error: File '/x' not found"`.
- `grep_raw(pattern: str, path: Optional[str] = None, glob: Optional[str] = None) -> list[GrepMatch] | str`
  - Return structured matches. For an invalid regex, return a string like `"Invalid regex pattern: ..."` (do not raise).
- `glob_info(pattern: str, path: str = "/") -> list[FileInfo]`
  - Return matched files as `FileInfo` entries (empty list if none).
- `write(file_path: str, content: str) -> WriteResult`
  - Create‑only. On conflict, return `WriteResult(error=...)`. On success, set `path` and for state backends set `files_update={...}`; external backends should use `files_update=None`.
- `edit(file_path: str, old_string: str, new_string: str, replace_all: bool = False) -> EditResult`
  - Enforce uniqueness of `old_string` unless `replace_all=True`. If not found, return error. Include `occurrences` on success.

Supporting types:
- `WriteResult(error, path, files_update)`
- `EditResult(error, path, files_update, occurrences)`
- `FileInfo` with fields: `path` (required), optionally `is_dir`, `size`, `modified_at`.
- `GrepMatch` with fields: `path`, `line`, `text`.
