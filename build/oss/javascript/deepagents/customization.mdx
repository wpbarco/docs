## Model

By default, `deepagents` uses `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`. You can customize this by passing any [LangChain model object](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


## System prompt

Deep agents come with a built-in system prompt inspired by Claude Code's system prompt. The default system prompt contains detailed instructions for using the built-in planning tool, file system tools, and subagents.

Each deep agent tailored to a use case should include a custom system prompt specific to that use case.



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


## Tools

Just like tool-calling agents, a deep agent gets a set of top level tools that it has access to.



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


In addition to any tools that you provide, deep agents also get access to a number of default tools:

- **write_todos** - Update the agent's to-do list
- **ls** - List all files in the agent's filesystem
- **read_file** - Read a file from the agent's filesystem
- **write_file** - Write a new file in the agent's filesystem
- **edit_file** - Edit an existing file in the agent's filesystem
- **task** - Spawn a subagent to handle a specific task
