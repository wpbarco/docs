    **LangGraph v1.0**

    Welcome to the new LangGraph documentation! If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/langchain-ai/docs/issues/new?template=02-langgraph.yml&labels=langgraph,js/ts) so we can improve. Archived v0 documentation can be found [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/).

    See the [release notes](/oss/javascript/releases/langgraph-v1) and [migration guide](/oss/javascript/migrate/langgraph-v1) for a complete list of changes and instructions on how to upgrade your code.
</Tip>


Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents-- including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more-- LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent **orchestration**. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with [models](/oss/javascript/langchain/models) and [tools](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools).

We will commonly use [LangChain](/oss/javascript/langchain/overview) components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don't need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting start with agents or want a higher level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain's [agents](/oss/javascript/langchain/agents) that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool calling loops.

LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

```bash bun
bun add @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>


Then, create a simple hello world example:



```typescript
import { MessagesAnnotation, StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const mockLlm = (state: typeof MessagesAnnotation.State) => {
  return { messages: [{ role: "ai", content: "hello world" }] };
};

const graph = new StateGraph(MessagesAnnotation)
  .addNode("mock_llm", mockLlm)
  .addEdge(START, "mock_llm")
  .addEdge("mock_llm", END)
  .compile();

await graph.invoke({ messages: [{ role: "user", content: "hi!" }] });
```


## Core benefits

LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure for *any* long-running, stateful workflow or agent. LangGraph does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides the following central benefits:

* [Durable execution](/oss/javascript/langgraph/durable-execution): Build agents that persist through failures and can run for extended periods, resuming from where they left off.
* [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts): Incorporate human oversight by inspecting and modifying agent state at any point.
* [Comprehensive memory](/oss/javascript/concepts/memory): Create stateful agents with both short-term working memory for ongoing reasoning and long-term memory across sessions.
* [Debugging with LangSmith](/langsmith/home): Gain deep visibility into complex agent behavior with visualization tools that trace execution paths, capture state transitions, and provide detailed runtime metrics.
* [Production-ready deployment](/langsmith/deployments): Deploy sophisticated agent systems confidently with scalable infrastructure designed to handle the unique challenges of stateful, long-running workflows.

## LangGraph ecosystem

While LangGraph can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools for building agents. To improve your LLM application development, pair LangGraph with:

* [LangSmith](http://www.langchain.com/langsmith) — Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
* [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) — Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams — and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in [Studio](/langsmith/studio).
* [LangChain](/oss/javascript/langchain/overview) - Provides integrations and composable components to streamline LLM application development. Contains agent abstractions built on top of LangGraph.

## Acknowledgements

LangGraph is inspired by [Pregel](https://research.google/pubs/pub37252/) and [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/). The public interface draws inspiration from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/latest/). LangGraph is built by LangChain Inc, the creators of LangChain, but can be used without LangChain.
