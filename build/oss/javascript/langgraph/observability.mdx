Traces are a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output. Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph). This enables you to do the following:

* [Debug a locally running application](/langsmith/observability-studio#debug-langsmith-traces).
* [Evaluate the application performance](/oss/javascript/langchain/evals).
* [Monitor the application](/langsmith/dashboards).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

## Enable tracing

To enable tracing for your application, set the following environment variables:

```python
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

By default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`. To configure a custom project name, see [Log to a project](#log-to-a-project).

For more information, see [Trace with LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).

## Use anonymizers to prevent logging of sensitive data in traces

You may want to mask sensitive data to prevent it from being logged to LangSmith. You can create [anonymizers](/langsmith/mask-inputs-outputs#rule-based-masking-of-inputs-and-outputs) and apply them to
your graph using configuration. This example will redact anything matching the Social Security Number format XXX-XX-XXXX from traces sent to LangSmith.


```typescript TypeScript
import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { LangChainTracer } from "@langchain/core/tracers/tracer_langchain";
import { StateAnnotation } from "./state.js";
import { createAnonymizer } from "langsmith/anonymizer"
import { Client } from "langsmith"


const anonymizer = createAnonymizer([
    # Matches SSNs
    { pattern: /\b\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}\b/, replace: "<ssn>" }
])

const langsmithClient = new Client({ anonymizer })
const tracer = new LangChainTracer({
  client: langsmithClient,
});

export const graph = new StateGraph(StateAnnotation)
  .compile()
  .withConfig({
    callbacks: [tracer],
});
```
