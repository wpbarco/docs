Your LangGraph [`StateGraph`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph) reached the maximum number of steps before hitting a stop condition.
This is often due to an infinite loop caused by code like the example below:



```typescript
import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const State = z.object({
  someKey: z.string(),
});

const builder = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("a", ...)
  .addNode("b", ...)
  .addEdge("a", "b")
  .addEdge("b", "a")
  ...

const graph = builder.compile();
```


However, complex graphs may hit the default limit naturally.

## Troubleshooting

* If you are not expecting your graph to go through many iterations, you likely have a cycle. Check your logic for infinite loops.



* If you have a complex graph, you can pass in a higher `recursionLimit` value into your `config` object when invoking your graph like this:

```typescript
await graph.invoke({...}, { recursionLimit: 100 });
```
