The **Functional API** allows you to add LangGraph's key features — [persistence](/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence), [memory](/oss/javascript/langgraph/add-memory), [human-in-the-loop](/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts), and [streaming](/oss/javascript/langgraph/streaming) — to your applications with minimal changes to your existing code.

It is designed to integrate these features into existing code that may use standard language primitives for branching and control flow, such as `if` statements, `for` loops, and function calls. Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.

The Functional API uses two key building blocks:



* **`entrypoint`** – An entrypoint encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.
* **`task`** – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.


This provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.

## Functional API vs. Graph API

For users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph's [Graph API](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api) allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.

Here are some key differences:

* **Control flow**: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.
* **Short-term memory**: The **GraphAPI** requires declaring a [**State**](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api#state) and may require defining [**reducers**](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api#reducers) to manage updates to the graph state. `@entrypoint` and `@tasks` do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.
* **Checkpointing**: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the **Graph API** a new checkpoint is generated after every [superstep](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api). In the **Functional API**, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.
* **Visualization**: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.

## Example

Below we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and [interrupts](/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts) to request human review.



```typescript
import { MemorySaver, entrypoint, task, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const writeEssay = task("writeEssay", async (topic: string) => {
  // A placeholder for a long-running task.
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  return `An essay about topic: ${topic}`;
});

const workflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer: new MemorySaver(), name: "workflow" },
  async (topic: string) => {
    const essay = await writeEssay(topic);
    const isApproved = interrupt({
      // Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
      // It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
      // from the workflow.
      essay, // The essay we want reviewed.
      // We can add any additional information that we need.
      // For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
      action: "Please approve/reject the essay",
    });

    return {
      essay, // The essay that was generated
      isApproved, // Response from HIL
    };
  }
);
```


<Accordion title="Detailed Explanation">
  This workflow will write an essay about the topic "cat" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.

  When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `writeEssay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.



  ```typescript
  import { v4 as uuidv4 } from "uuid";
  import { MemorySaver, entrypoint, task, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

  const writeEssay = task("writeEssay", async (topic: string) => {
    // This is a placeholder for a long-running task.
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
    return `An essay about topic: ${topic}`;
  });

  const workflow = entrypoint(
    { checkpointer: new MemorySaver(), name: "workflow" },
    async (topic: string) => {
      const essay = await writeEssay(topic);
      const isApproved = interrupt({
        // Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
        // It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
        // from the workflow.
        essay, // The essay we want reviewed.
        // We can add any additional information that we need.
        // For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
        action: "Please approve/reject the essay",
      });

      return {
        essay, // The essay that was generated
        isApproved, // Response from HIL
      };
    }
  );

  const threadId = uuidv4();

  const config = {
    configurable: {
      thread_id: threadId
    }
  };

  for await (const item of workflow.stream("cat", config)) {
    console.log(item);
  }
  ```

  ```console
  { writeEssay: 'An essay about topic: cat' }
  {
    __interrupt__: [{
      value: { essay: 'An essay about topic: cat', action: 'Please approve/reject the essay' },
      resumable: true,
      ns: ['workflow:f7b8508b-21c0-8b4c-5958-4e8de74d2684'],
      when: 'during'
    }]
  }
  ```

  An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:

  ```typescript
  import { Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

  // Get review from a user (e.g., via a UI)
  // In this case, we're using a bool, but this can be any json-serializable value.
  const humanReview = true;

  for await (const item of workflow.stream(new Command({ resume: humanReview }), config)) {
    console.log(item);
  }
  ```

  ```console
  { workflow: { essay: 'An essay about topic: cat', isApproved: true } }
  ```

  The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.

## Entrypoint



The [`entrypoint`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.entrypoint.html) function can be used to create a workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling _long-running tasks_ and [interrupts](/oss/javascript/langgraph/interrupts).


### Definition



An **entrypoint** is defined by calling the `entrypoint` function with configuration and a function.

The function **must accept a single positional argument**, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use an object as the input type for the first argument.

Creating an entrypoint with a function produces a workflow instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).

You will often want to pass a **checkpointer** to the `entrypoint` function to enable persistence and use features like **human-in-the-loop**.

```typescript
import { entrypoint } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
  async (someInput: Record<string, any>): Promise<number> => {
    // some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
    // and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
    return result;
  }
);
```


<Warning>
**Serialization**
The **inputs** and **outputs** of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the [serialization](#serialization) section for more details.
</Warning>



### Executing



Using the [`entrypoint`](#entrypoint) function will return an object that can be executed using the `invoke` and `stream` methods.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Invoke">
    ```typescript
    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };
    await myWorkflow.invoke(someInput, config); // Wait for the result
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Stream">
    ```typescript
    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };

    for await (const chunk of myWorkflow.stream(someInput, config)) {
      console.log(chunk);
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Resuming



Resuming an execution after an [interrupt](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.interrupt-2.html) can be done by passing a **resume** value to the [`Command`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Command.html) primitive.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Invoke">
    ```typescript
    import { Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };

    await myWorkflow.invoke(new Command({ resume: someResumeValue }), config);
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Stream">
    ```typescript
    import { Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };

    const stream = await myWorkflow.stream(
      new Command({ resume: someResumableValue }),
      config,
    )

    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      console.log(chunk);
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>




**Resuming after an error**

To resume after an error, run the `entrypoint` with `null` and the same **thread id** (config).

This assumes that the underlying **error** has been resolved and execution can proceed successfully.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Invoke">
    ```typescript
    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };

    await myWorkflow.invoke(null, config);
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Stream">
    ```typescript
    const config = {
      configurable: {
        thread_id: "some_thread_id"
      }
    };

    for await (const chunk of myWorkflow.stream(null, config)) {
      console.log(chunk);
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


### Short-term memory

When an `entrypoint` is defined with a `checkpointer`, it stores information between successive invocations on the same **thread id** in [checkpoints](/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints).



This allows accessing the state from the previous invocation using the `getPreviousState` function.

By default, the `getPreviousState` function returns the return value of the previous invocation.

```typescript
import { entrypoint, getPreviousState } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
  async (number: number) => {
    const previous = getPreviousState<number>() ?? 0;
    return number + previous;
  }
);

const config = {
  configurable: {
    thread_id: "some_thread_id",
  },
};

await myWorkflow.invoke(1, config); // 1 (previous was undefined)
await myWorkflow.invoke(2, config); // 3 (previous was 1 from the previous invocation)
```


#### `entrypoint.final`



[`entrypoint.final`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/functions/langgraph.entrypoint.html#final) is a special primitive that can be returned from an entrypoint and allows **decoupling** the value that is **saved in the checkpoint** from the **return value of the entrypoint**.

The first value is the return value of the entrypoint, and the second value is the value that will be saved in the checkpoint.

```typescript
import { entrypoint, getPreviousState } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
  async (number: number) => {
    const previous = getPreviousState<number>() ?? 0;
    // This will return the previous value to the caller, saving
    // 2 * number to the checkpoint, which will be used in the next invocation
    // for the `previous` parameter.
    return entrypoint.final({
      value: previous,
      save: 2 * number,
    });
  }
);

const config = {
  configurable: {
    thread_id: "1",
  },
};

await myWorkflow.invoke(3, config); // 0 (previous was undefined)
await myWorkflow.invoke(1, config); // 6 (previous was 3 * 2 from the previous invocation)
```


## Task

A **task** represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step. It has two key characteristics:

* **Asynchronous Execution**: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.
* **Checkpointing**: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See [persistence](/oss/javascript/langgraph/persistence) for more details).

### Definition



Tasks are defined using the `task` function, which wraps a regular function.

```typescript
import { task } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const slowComputation = task("slowComputation", async (inputValue: any) => {
  // Simulate a long-running operation
  return result;
});
```


<Warning>
**Serialization**
The **outputs** of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.
</Warning>

### Execution

**Tasks** can only be called from within an **entrypoint**, another **task**, or a [state graph node](/oss/javascript/langgraph/graph-api#nodes).

Tasks _cannot_ be called directly from the main application code.



When you call a **task**, it returns a Promise that can be awaited.

```typescript
const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
  { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
  async (someInput: number): Promise<number> => {
    return await slowComputation(someInput);
  }
);
```


## When to use a task

**Tasks** are useful in the following scenarios:

* **Checkpointing**: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don't need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.
* **Human-in-the-loop**: If you're building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use **tasks** to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the [determinism](#determinism) section for more details.
* **Parallel Execution**: For I/O-bound tasks, **tasks** enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).
* **Observability**: Wrapping operations in **tasks** provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).
* **Retryable Work**: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, **tasks** provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.

## Serialization

There are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:

1. `entrypoint` inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.
2. `task` outputs must be JSON-serializable.



These requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use primitives like objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.


Serialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.

Providing non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.

## Determinism

To utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same _sequence of steps_, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.

LangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](/oss/javascript/langgraph/use-subgraphs) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the _same sequence of steps_, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same.

While different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.

## Idempotency

Idempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside **tasks** functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a **task** starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the **task** will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.

## Common Pitfalls

### Handling side effects

Encapsulate side effects (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email) in tasks to ensure they are not executed multiple times when resuming a workflow.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Incorrect">
    In this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, so it will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.



    ```typescript
    import { entrypoint, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";
    import fs from "fs";

    const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
      { checkpointer, name: "workflow },
      async (inputs: Record<string, any>) => {
        // This code will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.
        // Which is likely not what you want.
        fs.writeFileSync("output.txt", "Side effect executed");
        const value = interrupt("question");
        return value;
      }
    );
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Correct">
    In this example, the side effect is encapsulated in a task, ensuring consistent execution upon resumption.



    ```typescript
    import { entrypoint, task, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";
    import * as fs from "fs";

    const writeToFile = task("writeToFile", async () => {
      fs.writeFileSync("output.txt", "Side effect executed");
    });

    const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
      { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
      async (inputs: Record<string, any>) => {
        // The side effect is now encapsulated in a task.
        await writeToFile();
        const value = interrupt("question");
        return value;
      }
    );
    ```

    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Non-deterministic control flow

Operations that might give different results each time (like getting current time or random numbers) should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure that on resume, the same result is returned.

* In a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → (returns 5 again) → ...
* Not in a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → get new random number (7) → ...



This is especially important when using **human-in-the-loop** workflows with multiple interrupt calls. LangGraph keeps a list of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it's matched with the corresponding resume value. This matching is strictly **index-based**, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.


If order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one `interrupt` call may be matched with the wrong `resume` value, leading to incorrect results.

Please read the section on [determinism](#determinism) for more details.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Incorrect">
    In this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.



    ```typescript
    import { entrypoint, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
      { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
      async (inputs: { t0: number }) => {
        const t1 = Date.now();

        const deltaT = t1 - inputs.t0;

        if (deltaT > 1000) {
          const result = await slowTask(1);
          const value = interrupt("question");
          return { result, value };
        } else {
          const result = await slowTask(2);
          const value = interrupt("question");
          return { result, value };
        }
      }
    );
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Correct">


    In this example, the workflow uses the input `t0` to determine which task to execute. This is deterministic because the result of the workflow depends only on the input.

    ```typescript
    import { entrypoint, task, interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

    const getTime = task("getTime", () => Date.now());

    const myWorkflow = entrypoint(
      { checkpointer, name: "workflow" },
      async (inputs: { t0: number }): Promise<any> => {
        const t1 = await getTime();

        const deltaT = t1 - inputs.t0;

        if (deltaT > 1000) {
          const result = await slowTask(1);
          const value = interrupt("question");
          return { result, value };
        } else {
          const result = await slowTask(2);
          const value = interrupt("question");
          return { result, value };
        }
      }
    );
    ```
