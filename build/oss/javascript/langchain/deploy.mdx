LangSmith is the fastest way to turn agents into production systems. Traditional hosting platforms are built for stateless, short-lived web apps, while LangGraph is **purpose-built for stateful, long-running agents**, so you can go from repo to reliable cloud deployment in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

## Deploy your agent

### 1. Create a repository on GitHub

Your application's code must reside in a GitHub repository to be deployed on LangSmith. Both public and private repositories are supported. For this quickstart, first make sure your app is LangGraph-compatible by following the [local server setup guide](/oss/javascript/langchain/studio#setup-local-langgraph-server). Then, push your code to the repository.
