[LLMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) are powerful AI tools that can interpret and generate text like humans. They're versatile enough to write content, translate languages, summarize, and answer questions without needing specialized training for each task.

In addition to text generation, many models support:

* <Icon icon="hammer" size={16} /> [Tool calling](#tool-calling) - calling external tools (like databases queries or API calls) and use results in their responses.
* <Icon icon="shapes" size={16} /> [Structured output](#structured-outputs) - where the model's response is constrained follow a defined format.
* <Icon icon="image" size={16} /> [Multimodal](#multimodal) - process and return data other than text, such as images, audio, and video.
* <Icon icon="brain" size={16} /> [Reasoning](#reasoning) - models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.

For provider-specific integration information and capabilities, see the provider's [integration page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers).

## Basic usage



The easiest way to get started with a model in LangChain is to use `initChatModel` to initialize one from a [provider](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers) of your choice.

```typescript Initialize a chat model
import { initChatModel } from "langchain";

const model = await initChatModel("openai:gpt-5-nano");
const response = await model.invoke("Why do parrots talk?");
```

See [`initChatModel`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/functions/langchain.chat_models_universal.initChatModel.html) for more detail.


### Key methods

<Card title="Invoke" href="#invoke" icon="paper-plane" arrow="true" horizontal>
    The model takes messages as input and outputs messages after generating a complete response.
</Card>
<Card title="Stream" href="#stream" icon="tower-broadcast" arrow="true" horizontal>
    Invoke the model, but stream the output as it is generated in real-time.
</Card>
<Card title="Batch" href="#batch" icon="grip" arrow="true" horizontal>
    Send multiple requests to a model in a batch for more efficient processing.
</Card>

<Info>
    In addition to chat models, LangChain provides support for other adjacent technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores. See the [integrations page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers) for details.
</Info>

## Parameters

A chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:

<ParamField body="model" type="string" required>
    The name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="apiKey" type="string">
    The key required for authenticating with the model's provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. Often accessed by setting an <Tooltip tip="A variable whose value is set outside the program, typically through functionality built into the operating system or microservice.">environment variable</Tooltip>.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="temperature" type="number">
    Controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher number makes responses more creative; lower ones make them more deterministic.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="stop" type="string[]">
    A sequence of characters that indicates when the model should stop generating its output.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="timeout" type="number">
    The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="maxTokens" type="number">
    Limits the total number of <Tooltip tip="The basic unit that a model reads and generates. Providers may define them differently, but in general, they can represent a whole or part of word.">tokens</Tooltip> in the response, effectively controlling how long the output can be.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="maxRetries" type="number">
    The maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.
</ParamField>

<Info>
    To find all the parameters supported by a given chat model, head to the [reference docs](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/index.html).

## Invocation

A chat model must be invoked to generate an output. There are three primary invocation methods, each suited to different use cases.



### Invoke

The most straightforward way to call a model is to use [`invoke()`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#invoke) with a single message or a list of messages.



```typescript Single message
const response = await model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?");
console.log(response);
```


A list of messages can be provided to a model to represent conversation history. Each message has a role that models use to indicate who sent the message in the conversation. See the [messages](/oss/javascript/langchain/messages) guide for more detail on roles, types, and content.



```typescript Conversation history
import { HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage } from "langchain";

const conversation = [
    new SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."),
    new HumanMessage("Translate: I love programming."),
    new AIMessage("J'adore la programmation."),
    new HumanMessage("Translate: I love building applications.")
];

const response = await model.invoke(conversation);
console.log(response);  // AIMessage("J'adore créer des applications.")
```


### Stream

Most models can stream their output content while it is being generated. By displaying output progressively, streaming significantly improves user experience, particularly for longer responses.

Calling [`stream()`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#stream) returns an <Tooltip tip="An object that progressively provides access to each item of a collection, in order.">iterator</Tooltip> that yields output chunks as they are produced. You can use a loop to process each chunk in real-time:


<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Basic text streaming
    const stream = await model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?");
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        console.log(chunk.text)
    }
    ```

    ```typescript Stream tool calls, reasoning, and other content
    const stream = await model.stream("What color is the sky?");
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        for (const block of chunk.contentBlocks) {
            if (block.type === "reasoning") {
                console.log(`Reasoning: ${block.reasoning}`);
            } else if (block.type === "tool_call_chunk") {
                console.log(`Tool call chunk: ${block}`);
            } else if (block.type === "text") {
                console.log(block.text);
            } else {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>


As opposed to `invoke()`, which returns a single [`AIMessage`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.messages_ai_message.AIMessage.html) after the model has finished generating its full response, `stream()` returns multiple [`AIMessageChunk`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.messages_ai_message.AIMessageChunk.html) objects, each containing a portion of the output text. Importantly, each chunk in a stream is designed to be gathered into a full message via summation:



```typescript Construct AIMessage
let full: AIMessageChunk | null = null;
for await (const chunk of stream) {
    full = full ? full.concat(chunk) : chunk;
    console.log(full.text);
}

// The
// The sky
// The sky is
// The sky is typically
// The sky is typically blue
// ...

console.log(full.contentBlocks);
// [{"type": "text", "text": "The sky is typically blue..."}]
```


The resulting message can be treated the same as a message that was generated with [`invoke()`](#invoke) - for example, it can be aggregated into a message history and passed back to the model as conversational context.

<Warning>
    Streaming only works if all steps in the program know how to process a stream of chunks. For instance, an application that isn't streaming-capable would be one that needs to store the entire output in memory before it can be processed.
</Warning>

<Accordion title="Advanced streaming topics">
    <Accordion title='"Auto-streaming" chat models'>
        LangChain simplifies streaming from chat models by automatically enabling streaming mode in certain cases, even when you're not explicitly calling the streaming methods. This is particularly useful when you use the non-streaming invoke method but still want to stream the entire application, including intermediate results from the chat model.

        In [LangGraph agents](/oss/javascript/langchain/agents), for example, you can call `model.invoke()` within nodes, but LangChain will automatically delegate to streaming if running in a streaming mode.

        #### How it works

        When you `invoke()` a chat model, LangChain will automatically switch to an internal streaming mode if it detects that you are trying to stream the overall application. The result of the invocation will be the same as far as the code that was using invoke is concerned; however, while the chat model is being streamed, LangChain will take care of invoking `on_llm_new_token` events in LangChain's callback system.


        Callback events allow LangGraph `stream()` and [`streamEvents()`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#streamEvents) to surface the chat model's output in real-time.

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Streaming events">


        LangChain chat models can also stream semantic events using
        [`streamEvents()`][BaseChatModel.streamEvents].

        This simplifies filtering based on event types and other metadata, and will aggregate the full message in the background. See below for an example.

        ```typescript
        const stream = await model.streamEvents("Hello");
        for await (const event of stream) {
            if (event.event === "on_chat_model_start") {
                console.log(`Input: ${event.data.input}`);
            }
            if (event.event === "on_chat_model_stream") {
                console.log(`Token: ${event.data.chunk.text}`);
            }
            if (event.event === "on_chat_model_end") {
                console.log(`Full message: ${event.data.output.text}`);
            }
        }
        ```
        ```txt
        Input: Hello
        Token: Hi
        Token:  there
        Token: !
        Token:  How
        Token:  can
        Token:  I
        ...
        Full message: Hi there! How can I help today?
        ```

        See the [`streamEvents()`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#streamEvents) reference for event types and other details.

    </Accordion>
</Accordion>

### Batch

Batching a collection of independent requests to a model can significantly improve performance and reduce costs, as the processing can be done in parallel:



```typescript Batch
const responses = await model.batch([
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?",
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?"
]);
for (const response of responses) {
    console.log(response);
}
```

<Tip>
    When processing a large number of inputs using `batch()`, you may want to control the maximum number of parallel calls. This can be done by setting the `maxConcurrency` attribute in the `RunnableConfig` dictionary.

    ```typescript Batch with max concurrency
    model.batch(
        listOfInputs,
        {
            maxConcurrency: 5,  // Limit to 5 parallel calls
        }
    )
    ```

    See the [`RunnableConfig`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.html) reference for a full list of supported attributes.
</Tip>

For more details on batching, see the [reference](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/_langchain_core.language_models_chat_models.BaseChatModel.html#batch).

## Tool calling

Models can request to call tools that perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, searching the web, or running code. Tools are pairings of:

1. A schema, including the name of the tool, a description, and/or argument definitions (often a JSON schema)
2. A function or <Tooltip tip="A method that can suspend execution and resume at a later time">coroutine</Tooltip> to execute.

<Note>
    You may hear the term "function calling". We use this interchangeably with "tool calling".
</Note>



To make tools that you have defined available for use by a model, you must bind them using [`bindTools()`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain.chat_models_universal.ConfigurableModel.html#bindTools). In subsequent invocations, the model can choose to call any of the bound tools as needed.


Some model providers offer built-in tools that can be enabled via model parameters. Check the respective [provider reference](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers) for details.

<Tip>
    See the [tools guide](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools) for details and other options for creating tools.
</Tip>



```typescript Binding user tools highlight={17}
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const getWeather = tool(
    (input) => {
        return `It's sunny in ${input.location}.`
    },
    {
        name: "get_weather",
        description: "Get the weather at a location.",
        schema: z.object({
            location: z.string().describe("The location to get the weather for")
        })
    }
)

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" })
const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([getWeather])

const response = await modelWithTools.invoke("What's the weather like in Boston?")
const toolCalls = response.tool_calls || []
for (const tool_call of toolCalls) {
    // View tool calls made by the model
    console.log(`Tool: ${tool_call.name}`);
    console.log(`Args: ${tool_call.args}`);
}
```


When binding user-defined tools, the model's response includes a **request** to execute a tool. It is up to you to perform the requested action and return the result back to the model for use in subsequent reasoning.

Below, we show some common ways you can use tool calling.



<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Tool execution loop" icon="arrow-rotate-right">
        When a model returns tool calls, you need to execute the tools and pass the results back to the model. This creates a conversation loop where the model can use tool results to generate its final response.

        ```typescript Tool execution loop
        //  Bind (potentially multiple) tools to the model
        const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([get_weather])

        // Step 1: Model generates tool calls
        const messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Boston?"}]
        const response = await modelWithTools.invoke(messages)
        messages.push(response)

        // Step 2: Execute tools and collect results
        for (const tool_call of response.tool_calls || []) {
            // Execute the tool with the generated arguments
            const tool_result = await get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
            messages.push(tool_result)
        }

        // Step 3: Pass results back to model for final response
        const final_response = await modelWithTools.invoke(messages)
        console.log(final_response.text)
        // "The current weather in Boston is 72°F and sunny."
        ```

        Each `ToolMessage` returned by the tool includes a `tool_call_id` that matches the original tool call, helping the model correlate results with requests.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Forcing tool calls" icon="asterisk">
        By default, the model has the freedom to choose which bound tool to use based on the user's input. However, you might want to force choosing a tool, ensuring the model uses either a particular tool or *any* tool from a given list:

        <CodeGroup>
            ```typescript Force use of any tool
            const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([tool_1], { toolChoice: "any" })
            ```

            ```typescript Force use of specific tools
            const modelWithTools = model.bindTools([tool_1], { toolChoice: "tool_1" })
            ```
        </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Parallel tool calls" icon="layer-group">
        Many models support calling multiple tools in parallel when appropriate. This allows the model to gather information from different sources simultaneously.

        ```typescript Parallel tool calls
        const modelWithTools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])

        const response = await modelWithTools.invoke(
            "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
        )


        // The model may generate multiple tool calls
        console.log(response.tool_calls)
        // [
        //   { name: 'get_weather', args: { location: 'Boston' }, id: 'call_1' },
        //   { name: 'get_time', args: { location: 'Tokyo' }, id: 'call_2' }
        // ]


        // Execute all tools (can be done in parallel with async)
        const results = []
        for (const tool_call of response.tool_calls || []) {
            if (tool_call.name === 'get_weather') {
                const result = await get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
                results.push(result)
            }
        }
        ```

        The model intelligently determines when parallel execution is appropriate based on the independence of the requested operations.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Streaming tool calls" icon="rss">
        When streaming responses, tool calls are progressively built through `ToolCallChunk`. This allows you to see tool calls as they're being generated rather than waiting for the complete response.

        ```typescript Streaming tool calls
        const stream = await modelWithTools.stream(
            "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
        )
        for await (const chunk of stream) {
            // Tool call chunks arrive progressively
            if (chunk.tool_call_chunks) {
                for (const tool_chunk of chunk.tool_call_chunks) {
                console.log(`Tool: ${tool_chunk.get('name', '')}`)
                console.log(`Args: ${tool_chunk.get('args', '')}`)
                }
            }
        }

        // Output:
        // Tool: get_weather
        // Args:
        // Tool:
        // Args: {"loc
        // Tool:
        // Args: ation": "BOS"}
        // Tool: get_time
        // Args:
        // Tool:
        // Args: {"timezone": "Tokyo"}
        ```

        You can accumulate chunks to build complete tool calls:

        ```typescript Accumulate tool calls
        let full: AIMessageChunk | null = null
        const stream = await modelWithTools.stream("What's the weather in Boston?")
        for await (const chunk of stream) {
            full = full ? full.concat(chunk) : chunk
            console.log(full.contentBlocks)
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Structured outputs

Models can be requested to provide their response in a format matching a given schema. This is useful for ensuring the output can be easily parsed and used in subsequent processing. LangChain supports multiple schema types and methods for enforcing structured outputs.



<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Zod">
        A [zod schema](https://zod.dev/) is the preferred method of defining an output schema. Note that when a zod schema is provided, the model output will also be validated against the schema using zod's parse methods.

        ```typescript
        import { z } from "zod";

        const Movie = z.object({
            title: z.string().describe("The title of the movie"),
            year: z.number().describe("The year the movie was released"),
            director: z.string().describe("The director of the movie"),
            rating: z.number().describe("The movie's rating out of 10"),
        });

        const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(Movie);

        const response = await modelWithStructure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception");
        console.log(response);
        // {
        //     title: "Inception",
        //     year: 2010,
        //     director: "Christopher Nolan",
        //     rating: 8.8,
        // }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JSON Schema">
        For maximum control or interoperability, you can provide a raw JSON Schema.

        ```typescript
        const jsonSchema = {
            "title": "Movie",
            "description": "A movie with details",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "title": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The title of the movie"
                },
                "year": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "description": "The year the movie was released"
                },
                "director": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "The director of the movie"
                },
                "rating": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "description": "The movie's rating out of 10"
                }
            },
            "required": ["title", "year", "director", "rating"]
        }

        const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(
            jsonSchema,
            { method: "jsonSchema" }
        )

        const response = await modelWithStructure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
        console.log(response)  // {'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010, ...}
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>




<Note>
    **Key considerations for structured outputs:**

    - **Method parameter**: Some providers support different methods (`'jsonSchema'`, `'functionCalling'`, `'jsonMode'`)
    - **Include raw**: Use `includeRaw=true` to get both the parsed output and the raw AI message
    - **Validation**: Zod models provide automatic validation, while JSON Schema requires manual validation
</Note>


<Accordion title="Example: Message output alongside parsed structure">

It can be useful to return the raw `AIMessage` object alongside the parsed representation to access response metadata such as [token counts](#token-usage):



    ```typescript highlight={10}
    import { z } from "zod";

    const Movie = z.object({
        title: z.string().describe("The title of the movie"),
        year: z.number().describe("The year the movie was released"),
        director: z.string().describe("The director of the movie"),
        rating: z.number().describe("The movie's rating out of 10"),
        title: z.string().describe("The title of the movie"),
        year: z.number().describe("The year the movie was released"),
        director: z.string().describe("The director of the movie"),
        rating: z.number().describe("The movie's rating out of 10"),
    });

    const modelWithStructure = model.withStructuredOutput(Movie, { includeRaw: true });

    const response = await modelWithStructure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception");
    console.log(response);
    // {
    //     raw: AIMessage { ... },
    //     parsed: { title: "Inception", ... }
    // }
    ```

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Example: Nested structures">


    ```typescript
    import { z } from "zod";

    const Actor = z.object({
    name: str
    role: z.string(),
    });

    const MovieDetails = z.object({
        title: z.string(),

## Supported models

LangChain supports all major model providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and more. Each provider offers a variety of models with different capabilities. For a full list of supported models in LangChain, see the [integrations page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers).

---

## Advanced configuration

### Multimodal

Certain models can process and return non-textual data such as images, audio, and video. You can pass non-textual data to a model by providing [content blocks](/oss/javascript/langchain/messages#content).

<Tip>
    All LangChain chat models with underlying multimodal capabilities support:

    1. Data in the cross-provider standard format (see [our messages guide](/oss/javascript/langchain/messages))
    2. OpenAI [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images-vision?api-mode=chat) format
    3. Any format that is native to that specific provider (e.g., Anthropic models accept Anthropic native format)
</Tip>

See the [multimodal section](/oss/javascript/langchain/messages#multimodal) of the messages guide for details.

Some models can also return multimodal data as part of their response. In such cases, the resulting `AIMessage` will have content blocks with multimodal types.



```typescript Multimodal output
const response = await model.invoke("Create a picture of a cat");
console.log(response.contentBlocks);
// [
//   { type: "text", text: "Here's a picture of a cat" },
//   { type: "image", data: "...", mimeType: "image/jpeg" },
// ]
```


See the [integrations page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers) for details on specific providers.

### Reasoning

Newer models are capable of performing multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. This involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.

If supported by the underlying model, you can surface this reasoning process to better understand how the model arrived at its final answer.



<CodeGroup>
    ```typescript Stream reasoning output
    const stream = model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?");
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
        const reasoningSteps = chunk.contentBlocks.filter(b => b.type === "reasoning");
        console.log(reasoningSteps.length > 0 ? reasoningSteps : chunk.text);
    }
    ```

    ```typescript Complete reasoning output
    const response = await model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?");
    const reasoningSteps = response.contentBlocks.filter(b => b.type === "reasoning");
    console.log(reasoningSteps.map(step => step.reasoning).join(" "));
    ```
</CodeGroup>


Depending on the model, you can sometimes specify the level of effort it should put into reasoning. Alternatively, you can request that the model turn off reasoning entirely. This may take the form of categorical "tiers" of reasoning (e.g., `'low'` or `'high'`) or integer token budgets.

For details, see the relevant chat model in the [integrations page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers).


### Local models

LangChain supports running models locally on your own hardware. This is useful for scenarios where data privacy is critical, or when you want to avoid the cost of using a cloud-based model.

[Ollama](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/ollama) is one of the easiest ways to run models locally. See the full list of local integrations on the [integrations page](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers).

### Caching

Chat model APIs can be slow and expensive to call. To help mitigate this, LangChain provides an optional caching layer for chat model integrations.



<Accordion title="Enable caching for your model" icon="database">
    To enable caching, you can provide a cache object when initializing the model:

    <AccordionGroup>
        <Accordion title="In Memory Cache" icon="memory">
            An ephemeral cache that stores model calls in memory. Wiped when your environment restarts. Not shared across processes.

            ```typescript InMemoryCache
            import { InMemoryCache } from "@langchain/core";
            import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

            const model = new ChatOpenAI({
                model: "gpt-4o",
                cache: new InMemoryCache(),
            });

            const response = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke");
            const response = await model.invoke("Tell me a joke");  // Fast, from cache
            ```
        </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
</Accordion>




### Base URL or proxy

For many chat model integrations, you can configure the base URL for API requests, which allows you to use model providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs or to use a proxy server.

<Accordion title="Base URL" icon="link">


    Many model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). You can use `initChatModel` with these providers by specifying the appropriate `base_url` parameter:

    ```python
    model = initChatModel(
        "MODEL_NAME",
        {
            modelProvider: "openai",
            baseUrl: "BASE_URL",
            apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
        }
    )
    ```


    <Note>
        When using direct chat model class instantiation, the parameter name may vary by provider. Check the respective [reference](/oss/javascript/integrations/providers) for details.
    </Note>
</Accordion>




### Log probabilities

Certain models can be configured to return token-level log probabilities representing the likelihood of a given token by setting the `logprobs` parameter when initializing the model:



```typescript
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
    model: "gpt-4o",
    logprobs: true,
});

const responseMessage = await model.invoke("Why do parrots talk?");

responseMessage.response_metadata.logprobs.content.slice(0, 5);
```


### Token usage

A number of model providers return token usage information as part of the invocation response. When available, this information will be included on the `AIMessage` objects produced by the corresponding model. For more details, see the [messages](/oss/javascript/langchain/messages) guide.

<Note>
    Some provider APIs, notably OpenAI and Azure OpenAI chat completions, require users opt-in to receiving token usage data in streaming contexts. See the [streaming usage metadata](/oss/javascript/integrations/chat/openai#streaming-usage-metadata) section of the integration guide for details.
</Note>



### Invocation config



When invoking a model, you can pass additional configuration through the `config` parameter using a [`RunnableConfig`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.html) object. This provides run-time control over execution behavior, callbacks, and metadata tracking.


Common configuration options include:



```typescript Invocation with config
const response = await model.invoke(
    "Tell me a joke",
    {
        runName: "joke_generation",      // Custom name for this run
        tags: ["humor", "demo"],          // Tags for categorization
        metadata: {"user_id": "123"},     // Custom metadata
        callbacks: [my_callback_handler], // Callback handlers
    }
)
```




<Accordion title="Key configuration attributes">
    <ParamField body="runName" type="string">
        Identifies this specific invocation in logs and traces. Not inherited by sub-calls.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="tags" type="string[]">
        Labels inherited by all sub-calls for filtering and organization in debugging tools.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
        Custom key-value pairs for tracking additional context, inherited by all sub-calls.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="maxConcurrency" type="number">
        Controls the maximum number of parallel calls when using `batch()`.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="callbacks" type="CallbackHandler[]">
        Handlers for monitoring and responding to events during execution.
    </ParamField>

    <ParamField body="recursion_limit" type="number">
        Maximum recursion depth for chains to prevent infinite loops in complex pipelines.
    </ParamField>
</Accordion>


These configuration values are particularly useful when:
- Debugging with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) tracing
- Implementing custom logging or monitoring
- Controlling resource usage in production
- Tracking invocations across complex pipelines

For more information on all supported `RunnableConfig` attributes, see the [`RunnableConfig`](https://v03.api.js.langchain.com/interfaces/_langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.html) reference.
