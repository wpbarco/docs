LangChain.js offers experimental support for Neural Internet's Bittensor LLM models.

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { NIBittensorLLM } from "@langchain/classic/experimental/llms/bittensor";

const model = new NIBittensorLLM();

const res = await model.invoke(`What is Bittensor?`);

console.log({ res });

/*
  {
    res: "\nBittensor is opensource protocol..."
  }
 */
```
