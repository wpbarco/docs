> [Friendli](https://friendli.ai/) enhances AI application performance and optimizes cost savings with scalable, efficient deployment options, tailored for high-demand AI workloads.

This tutorial guides you through integrating `Friendli` with LangChain.

## Setup

Ensure the `@langchain/community` is installed.

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

Sign in to [Friendli Suite](https://suite.friendli.ai/) to create a Personal Access Token, and set it as the `FRIENDLI_TOKEN` environment.
You can set team id as `FRIENDLI_TEAM` environment.

You can initialize a Friendli chat model with selecting the model you want to use. The default model is `mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1`. You can check the available models at [docs.friendli.ai](https://docs.friendli.ai/guides/serverless_endpoints/pricing#text-generation-models).

## Usage

```typescript
import { Friendli } from "@langchain/community/llms/friendli";

const model = new Friendli({
  model: "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0-1", // Default value
  friendliToken: process.env.FRIENDLI_TOKEN,
  friendliTeam: process.env.FRIENDLI_TEAM,
  maxTokens: 18,
  temperature: 0.75,
  topP: 0.25,
  frequencyPenalty: 0,
  stop: [],
});

const response = await model.invoke(
  "Check the Grammar: She dont like to eat vegetables, but she loves fruits."
);

console.log(response);

/*
Correct: She doesn't like to eat vegetables, but she loves fruits
*/

const stream = await model.stream(
  "Check the Grammar: She dont like to eat vegetables, but she loves fruits."
);

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}

/*

```
