title: Time-Weighted Retriever
---

A Time-Weighted Retriever is a retriever that takes into account recency in addition to similarity. The scoring algorithm is:

```typescript
let score = (1.0 - this.decayRate) ** hoursPassed + vectorRelevance;
```

Notably, `hoursPassed` above refers to the time since the object in the retriever was last accessed, not since it was created. This means that frequently accessed objects remain "fresh" and score higher.

`this.decayRate` is a configurable decimal number between 0 and 1. A lower number means that documents will be "remembered" for longer, while a higher number strongly weights more recently accessed documents.

Note that setting a decay rate of exactly 0 or 1 makes `hoursPassed` irrelevant and makes this retriever equivalent to a standard vector lookup.

## Usage

This example shows how to intialize a `TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever` with a vector store.
It is important to note that due to required metadata, all documents must be added to the backing vector store using the `addDocuments` method on the **retriever**, not the vector store itself.

```typescript
import { TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever } from "@langchain/classic/retrievers/time_weighted";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "@langchain/classic/vectorstores/memory";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const vectorStore = new MemoryVectorStore(new OpenAIEmbeddings());

const retriever = new TimeWeightedVectorStoreRetriever({
  vectorStore,
  memoryStream: [],
  searchKwargs: 2,
});

const documents = [
  "My name is John.",
  "My name is Bob.",
  "My favourite food is pizza.",
  "My favourite food is pasta.",
  "My favourite food is sushi.",
].map((pageContent) => ({ pageContent, metadata: {} }));

// All documents must be added using this method on the retriever (not the vector store!)
// so that the correct access history metadata is populated
await retriever.addDocuments(documents);

const results1 = await retriever.invoke("What is my favourite food?");

console.log(results1);

/*
[
  Document { pageContent: 'My favourite food is pasta.', metadata: {} }
]
 */

const results2 = await retriever.invoke("What is my favourite food?");

console.log(results2);

/*
[
  Document { pageContent: 'My favourite food is pasta.', metadata: {} }
]
 */
```
