title: Azure Blob Storage Container
---

<Tip>
**Compatibility**

Only available on Node.js.
</Tip>

This covers how to load a container on Azure Blob Storage into LangChain documents.

## Setup

To run this loader, you'll need to have Unstructured already set up and ready to use at an available URL endpoint. It can also be configured to run locally.

See the docs [here](/oss/javascript/integrations/document_loaders/file_loaders/unstructured) for information on how to do that.

You'll also need to install the official Azure Storage Blob client library:

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @azure/storage-blob
```

## Usage

Once Unstructured is configured, you can use the Azure Blob Storage Container loader to load files and then convert them into a Document.

```typescript
import { AzureBlobStorageContainerLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/azure_blob_storage_container";

const loader = new AzureBlobStorageContainerLoader({
  azureConfig: {
    connectionString: "",
    container: "container_name",
  },
  unstructuredConfig: {
    apiUrl: "http://localhost:8000/general/v0/general",
    apiKey: "", // this will be soon required
  },
});

const docs = await loader.load();

console.log(docs);
```
