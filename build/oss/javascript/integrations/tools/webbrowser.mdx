title: Web Browser Tool
---

The Webbrowser Tool gives your agent the ability to visit a website and extract information. It is described to the agent as

```
useful for when you need to find something on or summarize a webpage. input should be a comma separated list of "valid URL including protocol","what you want to find on the page or empty string for a summary".
```

It exposes two modes of operation:

- when called by the Agent with only a URL it produces a summary of the website contents
- when called by the Agent with a URL and a description of what to find it will instead use an in-memory Vector Store to find the most relevant snippets and summarise those

## Setup

To use the Webbrowser Tool you need to install the dependencies:

```bash npm
npm install cheerio axios
```
## Usage, standalone

```typescript
import { WebBrowser } from "@langchain/classic/tools/webbrowser";
import { ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

export async function run() {
  const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o-mini", temperature: 0 });
  const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings();

  const browser = new WebBrowser({ model, embeddings });

  const result = await browser.invoke(
    `"https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/04/09/find-your-bliss-joseph-campbell-power-of-myth","who is joseph campbell"`
  );

  console.log(result);
  /*
  Joseph Campbell was a mythologist and writer who discussed spirituality, psychological archetypes, cultural myths, and the mythology of self. He sat down with Bill Moyers for a lengthy conversation at George Lucas’s Skywalker Ranch in California, which continued the following year at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The resulting 24 hours of raw footage were edited down to six one-hour episodes and broadcast on PBS in 1988, shortly after Campbell’s death, in what became one of the most popular in the history of public television.

## Usage, in an Agent

```typescript
import { OpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions } from "@langchain/classic/agents";
import { Calculator } from "@langchain/community/tools/calculator";
import { WebBrowser } from "@langchain/classic/tools/webbrowser";
import { SerpAPI } from "@langchain/community/tools/serpapi";

export const run = async () => {
  const model = new OpenAI({ temperature: 0 });
  const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings();
  const tools = [
    new SerpAPI(process.env.SERPAPI_API_KEY, {
      location: "Austin,Texas,United States",
      hl: "en",
      gl: "us",
    }),
    new Calculator(),
    new WebBrowser({ model, embeddings }),
  ];

  const executor = await initializeAgentExecutorWithOptions(tools, model, {
    agentType: "zero-shot-react-description",
    verbose: true,
  });
  console.log("Loaded agent.");

  const input = `What is the word of the day on merriam webster. What is the top result on google for that word`;

  console.log(`Executing with input "${input}"...`);

  const result = await executor.invoke({ input });
  /*
