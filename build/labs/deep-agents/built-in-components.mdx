title: Built-in components
---

Deep Agents comes with a number of built-in components that help agents perform complex tasks.

## System prompt

Deep Agents comes with a detailed system prompt heavily inspired by Claude Code's architecture. This prompt provides instructions for using the planning tool, file system tools, and sub agents effectively.

## Planning tool

A simple planning tool based on Claude Code's TodoWrite functionality that helps agents create and track plans in their context, keeping them on track for complex tasks.

## File system tools

Four built-in tools that mock a file system using LangGraph's state:

- `ls` - List files and directories
- `read_file` - Read file contents
- `write_file` - Write to files
- `edit_file` - Edit existing files

Files can be passed in and retrieved via the files key:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Pass files to the agent
result = agent.invoke({
    "messages": [...],
    "files": {"foo.txt": "file content", ...}
})

# Access files after execution
updated_files = result["files"]
```

```typescript JavaScript
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [...],
  // Pass in files to the agent using this key
  files: {"foo.txt": "foo", ...}
});

// Access any files afterwards like this
result.files;
```

</CodeGroup>

## Sub-agents

Built-in support for calling specialized sub-agents with the following:

- **Context quarantine**: Prevents polluting the main agent's context
- **Custom instructions**: Tailored prompts for specific tasks
- **Tool access control**: Subagents can have different tool sets

A general-purpose sub-agent with the same instructions and tools as the main agent is always available.

## MCP

The `deepagents` library can be ran with MCP tools. This can be achieved by using the [LangChain MCP Adapter library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters).

For example:

```python
# pip install langchain-mcp-adapters

import asyncio
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

async def main():
    # Collect MCP tools
    mcp_client = MultiServerMCPClient(...)
    mcp_tools = await mcp_client.get_tools()

    # Create agent
    agent = create_deep_agent(tools=mcp_tools, ....)

    # Stream the agent
    async for chunk in agent.astream(
        {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is langgraph?"}]},
        stream_mode="values"
    ):
        if "messages" in chunk:
            chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

asyncio.run(main())
```
