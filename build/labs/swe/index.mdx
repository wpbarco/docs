Open SWE is an open source cloud-based coding agent built with [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/javascript/langgraph/overview). It's designed to autonomously understand, plan, and execute code changes across entire repositories.

## How It Works

Open SWE operates through three specialized LangGraph agents:

- **Manager Graph**: Orchestrates user interactions and coordinates between other graphs
- **Planner Graph**: Analyzes requirements and creates detailed execution plans
- **Programmer Graph**: Executes code changes based on approved plans

The agent can be used through a web interface or triggered automatically via GitHub webhooks, making it flexible for both interactive development and automated workflows.
