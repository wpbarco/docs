## Skip CI until last commit

Open SWE will push a commit after every change to the repository. This will cause your GitHub CI workflows to run for every commit, which is unnecessary.

To prevent this, Open SWE supports adding an environment variable which will append `[skip ci]` to the commit message. This can be used to make GitHub skip CI for that commit.

Below are instructions showing how to use this to skip creating Vercel CI preview deployments on every commit:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set the environment variable">
    Set the environment variable `SKIP_CI_UNTIL_LAST_COMMIT` to `true` in Open SWE's environment variables:

    `apps/open-swe/.env`
    ```bash
    SKIP_CI_UNTIL_LAST_COMMIT="true"
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add custom 'Ignored Build Step' in Vercel">
    Add a custom 'Ignored Build Step' in Vercel to skip CI when commit messages contain the string `[skip ci]`.

    1. Navigate to your Vercel project dashboard
    2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Git** tab
    3. Scroll to **Ignored Build Step** section
    4. Select **Custom** and add the following script:

    ```bash
    git log -1 --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit | grep -w "\[skip ci\]" && exit 0 || exit 1
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
      **Do not test this command locally** as it will close your terminal. Use the testing method below instead.
    </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the configuration (optional)">
    To verify your setup works without closing your terminal, use this safe testing command:

    ```bash
    # Safe local testing - won't close your terminal
    if git log -1 --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit | grep -w "\[skip ci\]"; then
        echo "Found [skip ci] - Vercel would skip this build"
    else
        echo "No [skip ci] found - Vercel would proceed with build"
    fi
    ```

    Test with both types of commits:
    - Commits with `[skip ci]` should show "Vercel would skip this build"
    - Commits without `[skip ci]` should show "Vercel would proceed with build"

  </Step>
</Steps>

### How it works

1. **During task execution**: Open SWE includes `[skip ci]` in commit messages
2. **Vercel behavior**: Skips creating preview deployments for these commits (script exits with code 1)
3. **Task completion**: Open SWE pushes a final commit without `[skip ci]` to trigger deployment (script exits with code 0)
4. **Result**: Only one preview deployment per Open SWE task
