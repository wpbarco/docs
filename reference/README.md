# LangChain Reference Docs

Reference documentation is not consolidated into our primary Mintlify website ([`docs.langchain.com`](https://docs.langchain.com)) due to limitations in the Mintlify platform. Instead, we deploy static documentation sites for our Python and JavaScript/TypeScript references.

Currently, a Vercel project serves the built HTML from the `dist/language` directories at [`reference.langchain.com/python`](https://reference.langchain.com/python) and [`reference.langchain.com/javascript`](https://reference.langchain.com/javascript).

See the [`reference/python/README.md`](./python/README.md) and [`reference/javascript/README.md`](./javascript/README.md) files for more information on how each are built and deployed.
