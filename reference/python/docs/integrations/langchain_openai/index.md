Use the sidebar to navigate the various modules in this package.

Refer to [the docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/openai) for a high-level guide on how to use each module. These reference pages contain auto-generated API documentation for each module, focusing on the "what" rather than the "how" or "why" (i.e. no end-to-end tutorials or conceptual overviews).
