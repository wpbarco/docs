!!! note "Usage documentation"
    Refer to [the docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/google) for a high-level guide on how to use each module. These reference pages contain auto-generated API documentation for each module, focusing on the "what" rather than the "how" or "why" (i.e. no end-to-end tutorials or conceptual overviews).

Refer to the package directory in the sidebar.
