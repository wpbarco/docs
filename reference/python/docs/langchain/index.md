Welcome to the LangChain package reference documentation!

There are three main packages in the LangChain ecosystem, though most users will primarily interact with the main `langchain` package:

- [`langchain`](./index.md): The main entrypoint containing all implementations you need for building applications with models.
- [`langchain-core`](../langchain_core/index.md): Core interfaces and abstractions used across the LangChain ecosystem.
- [`langchain-classic`](../langchain_classic/index.md): WIP.
