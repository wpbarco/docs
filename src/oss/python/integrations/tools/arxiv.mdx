This notebook goes over how to use the `arxiv` tool with an agent.

First, you need to install the `arxiv` python package.

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-community arxiv
```

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["arxiv"],
)
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

agent = create_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "What's the paper 1605.08386 about?",
    }
)
```

Title: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases
Authors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch
Summary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of
allowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on
fibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We
then study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We
also state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random
walk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed
dimension.The paper "1605.08386" is titled "Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases" and is authored by Caprice Stanley and Tobias Windisch. It was published on May 26, 2016. The paper discusses the study of graphs on lattice points with edges coming from a finite set of allowed moves. It explores the diameter of these graphs and the mixing behavior of heat-bath random walks on them. The paper also discusses conditions for the heat-bath random walk to be an expander in fixed dimension.
Final Answer: The paper "1605.08386" is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases.

## The ArXiv API Wrapper

The tool uses the `API Wrapper`. Below, we explore some of the features it provides.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import ArxivAPIWrapper
```

You can use the ArxivAPIWrapper to get information about a scientific article or articles. The query text is limited to 300 characters.

The ArxivAPIWrapper returns these article fields:

- Publishing date
- Title
- Authors
- Summary

The following query returns information about one article with the arxiv ID "1605.08386".

```python
arxiv = ArxivAPIWrapper()
docs = arxiv.run("1605.08386")
docs
```

```output
'Published: 2016-05-26\nTitle: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch\nSummary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on\nfibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We\nthen study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We\nalso state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random\nwalk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed\ndimension.'
```

Now, we want to get information about one author, `Caprice Stanley`.

This query returns information about three articles. By default, the query returns information only about three top articles.

```python
docs = arxiv.run("Caprice Stanley")
docs
```

```output
'Published: 2017-10-10\nTitle: On Mixing Behavior of a Family of Random Walks Determined by a Linear Recurrence\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Seth Sullivant\nSummary: We study random walks on the integers mod $G_n$ that are determined by an\ninteger sequence $\\{ G_n \\}_{n \\geq 1}$ generated by a linear recurrence\nrelation. Fourier analysis provides explicit formulas to compute the\neigenvalues of the transition matrices and we use this to bound the mixing time\nof the random walks.\n\nPublished: 2016-05-26\nTitle: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch\nSummary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length.

An\nagreement of calculated fluxes with data on charged particles from the AMS and\nCAPRICE detectors is demonstrated. Predictions on neutrino fluxes at different\nexperimental sites are compared with results from other calculations.'

Now, we are trying to find information about non-existing article. In this case, the response is "No good Arxiv Result was found"

```python
docs = arxiv.run("1605.08386WWW")
docs

```output
'No good Arxiv Result was found'
