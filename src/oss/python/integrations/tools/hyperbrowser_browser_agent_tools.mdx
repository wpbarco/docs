[Hyperbrowser](https://hyperbrowser.ai) is a platform for running, running browser agents, and scaling headless browsers. It lets you launch and manage browser sessions at scale and provides easy to use solutions for any webscraping needs, such as scraping a single page or crawling an entire site.

Key Features:

- Instant Scalability - Spin up hundreds of browser sessions in seconds without infrastructure headaches
- Simple Integration - Works seamlessly with popular tools like Puppeteer and Playwright
- Powerful APIs - Easy to use APIs for scraping/crawling any site, and much more
- Bypass Anti-Bot Measures - Built-in stealth mode, ad blocking, automatic CAPTCHA solving, and rotating proxies

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Hyperbrowser tools.

## Browser Agents

Hyperbrowser provides powerful browser agent tools that enable AI models to interact with web browsers programmatically. These browser agents can navigate websites, fill forms, click buttons, extract data, and perform complex web automation tasks.

Browser agents are particularly useful for:

- Web scraping and data extraction from complex websites
- Automating repetitive web tasks
- Interacting with web applications that require authentication
- Performing research across multiple websites
- Testing web applications

Hyperbrowser offers three types of browser agent tools:

- **Browser Use Tool**: A general-purpose browser automation tool
- **OpenAI CUA Tool**: Integration with OpenAI's Computer Use Agent
- **Claude Computer Use Tool**: Integration with Anthropic's Claude for computer use

```bash
export HYPERBROWSER_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

### Installation

Install **langchain-hyperbrowser**.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-hyperbrowser
```

## Instantiation

### Browser Use Tool

The `HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool` is a tool to perform web automation tasks using a browser agent, specifically the Browser-Use agent.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool
tool = HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool()
```

### OpenAI CUA Tool

The `HyperbrowserOpenAICUATool` is a specialized tool that leverages OpenAI's Computer Use Agent (CUA) capabilities through Hyperbrowser.

```python
from langchain_hyperbrowser import HyperbrowserOpenAICUATool

```

### Async Usage

All tools support async usage:

```python
async def browse_website():
    tool = HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool()
    result = await tool.arun(
        {
            "task": "Go to npmjs.com, click the first visible package, and tell me when it was updated"
        }
    )
    return result


result = await browse_website()
```

```output
{'data': 'The page displays information about the "Example Domain," stating that it is used for illustrative purposes and can be utilized without permission. There\'s a link to "More information..." but no specific contact details are provided.', 'error': None}
```

## Use within an agent

Here's how to use any of the Hyperbrowser tools within an agent:

```python
from langchain.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder
from langchain_hyperbrowser import browser_use_tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_agent


model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

# You can use any of the three tools here
browser_use_tool = HyperbrowserBrowserUseTool()
agent = create_agent(model, [browser_use_tool])

user_input = "Go to npmjs.com, and tell me when react package was last updated."
for step in agent.stream(
    {"messages": user_input},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```output
================================ Human Message =================================

Go to npmjs.com, and tell me when react package was last updated.
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  hyperbrowser_browser_use (call_pkAaDjn6kKH9yT3rHDb4hmET)
