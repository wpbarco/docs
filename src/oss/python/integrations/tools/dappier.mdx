# Dappier Tool

This will help you get started with the Dappier [tool](/oss/langchain/tools). For detailed documentation of all DappierRetriever features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/tools/langchain_dappier.tools.Dappier.DappierRealTimeSearchTool.html).

## Overview

The DappierRealTimeSearchTool and DappierAIRecommendationTool empower AI applications with real-time data and AI-driven insights. The former provides access to up-to-date information across news, weather, travel, and financial markets, while the latter supercharges applications with factual, premium content from diverse domains like News, Finance, and Sports, all powered by Dappier's pre-trained RAG models and natural language APIs.

### Setup

This tool lives in the `langchain-dappier` package.

```python
pip install -qU langchain-dappier
```

### Credentials

We also need to set our Dappier API credentials, which can be generated at the [Dappier site.](https://platform.dappier.com/profile/api-keys).

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.environ.get("DAPPIER_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["DAPPIER_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Dappier API key:\n")
```

If you want to get automated tracing from individual queries, you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

## DappierRealTimeSearchTool

Access real-time Google search results, including the latest news, weather, travel, and deals, along with up-to-date financial news, stock prices, and trades from polygon.io, all powered by AI insights to keep you informed.

### Instantiation

- ai_model_id: str
    The AI model ID to use for the query. The AI model ID always starts
    with the prefix "am_".

    Defaults to "am_01j06ytn18ejftedz6dyhz2b15".

    Multiple AI model IDs are available, which can be found at:
    [marketplace.dappier.com/marketplace](https://marketplace.dappier.com/marketplace)

```python
from langchain_dappier import DappierRealTimeSearchTool

tool = DappierRealTimeSearchTool(
    # ai_model_id="...",     # overwrite default ai_model_id
    # name="...",            # overwrite default tool name
    # description="...",     # overwrite default tool description
    # args_schema=...,       # overwrite default args_schema: BaseModel
)
```

### Invocation

#### [Invoke directly with args](/oss/langchain/tools)

The `DappierRealTimeSearchTool` takes a single "query" argument, which should be a natural language query:

```python
tool.invoke({"query": "What happened at the last wimbledon"})
```

```output
"At the last Wimbledon in 2024, Carlos Alcaraz won the title by defeating Novak Djokovic. This victory marked Alcaraz's fourth Grand Slam title at just 21 years old! üéâüèÜüéæ"
```

### [Invoke with ToolCall](/oss/langchain/tools)

We can also invoke the tool with a model-generated ToolCall, in which case a ToolMessage will be returned:

```python
# This is usually generated by a model, but we'll create a tool call directly for demo purposes.
model_generated_tool_call = {
    "args": {"query": "euro 2024 host nation"},
    "id": "1",
    "name": "dappier",
    "type": "tool_call",
}
tool_msg = tool.invoke(model_generated_tool_call)

# The content is a JSON string of results
print(tool_msg.content[:400])
```

```output
Euro 2024 is being hosted by Germany! üá©üá™ The tournament runs from June 14 to July 14, 2024, featuring 24 teams competing across various cities like Berlin and Munich. It's going to be an exciting summer of football! ‚öΩÔ∏èüèÜ
```

### Chaining

We can use our tool in a chain by first binding it to a [tool-calling model](/oss/langchain/tools/) and then calling it:

<ChatModelTabs customVarName="llm" />

```python
# | output: false
# | echo: false

# !pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model(model="gpt-4o", model_provider="openai", temperature=0)
```

```python
import datetime

from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig, chain

today = datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%D")
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        ("system", f"You are a helpful assistant. The date today is {today}."),
        ("human", "{user_input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{messages}"),
    ]
)

# specifying tool_choice will force the model to call this tool.
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool])

model_chain = prompt | model_with_tools


@chain
def tool_chain(user_input: str, config: RunnableConfig):
    input_ = {"user_input": user_input}
    ai_msg = model_chain.invoke(input_, config=config)
    tool_msgs = tool.batch(ai_msg.tool_calls, config=config)
    return model_chain.invoke({**input_, "messages": [ai_msg, *tool_msgs]}, config=config)


tool_chain.invoke("who won the last womens singles wimbledon")
```

```output
AIMessage(content="Barbora Krejƒç√≠kov√° won the women's singles title at Wimbledon 2024, defeating Jasmine Paolini in the final with a score of 6‚Äì2, 2‚Äì6, 6‚Äì4.

Guerrero's impressive offensive stats make him a valuable target, and discussions are in the early stages.
