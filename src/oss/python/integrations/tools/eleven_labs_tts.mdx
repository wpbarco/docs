title: ElevenLabs Text2Speech
---

This notebook shows how to interact with the `ElevenLabs API` to achieve text-to-speech capabilities.

First, you need to set up an ElevenLabs account. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.elevenlabs.io/welcome/introduction).

```python
pip install -qU  elevenlabs langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"] = ""
```

## Usage

```python
from langchain_community.tools import ElevenLabsText2SpeechTool

text_to_speak = "Hello world! I am the real slim shady"

tts = ElevenLabsText2SpeechTool()
tts.name
```

```output
'eleven_labs_text2speech'
```

We can generate audio, save it to the temporary file and then play it.

```python
speech_file = tts.run(text_to_speak)
tts.play(speech_file)
```

Or stream audio directly.

```python
tts.stream_speech(text_to_speak)
```

## Use within an Agent

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["eleven_labs_text2speech"])
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
audio_file = agent.run("Tell me a joke and read it out for me.")
```

```output
> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
Action:
\`\`\`
{
  "action": "eleven_labs_text2speech",
  "action_input": {
    "query": "Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide!"
  }
}
\`\`\`


Observation: /tmp/tmpsfg783f1.wav
Thought: I have the audio file ready to be sent to the human
Action:
\`\`\`
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
  "action_input": "/tmp/tmpsfg783f1.wav"
}
\`\`\`



> Finished chain.
```

```python
tts.play(audio_file)
```
