title: Split markdown
---

Many chat or Q&A applications involve chunking input documents prior to embedding and vector storage.

[These notes](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/chunking-strategies/) from Pinecone provide some useful tips:

```wrap
When a full paragraph or document is embedded, the embedding process considers both the overall context and the relationships between the sentences and phrases within the text. This can result in a more comprehensive vector representation that captures the broader meaning and themes of the text.
```

As mentioned, chunking often aims to keep text with common context together. With this in mind, we might want to specifically honor the structure of the document itself. For example, a markdown file is organized by headers. Creating chunks within specific header groups is an intuitive idea. To address this challenge, we can use [MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/markdown/langchain_text_splitters.markdown.MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter.html). This will split a markdown file by a specified set of headers.

For example, if we want to split this markdown:
```markdown
md = '# Foo\n\n ## Bar\n\nHi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe\n\n ## Baz\n\n Hi this is Molly'
```

We can specify the headers to split on:
```python
[("#", "Header 1"),("##", "Header 2")]
```

And content is grouped or split by common headers:
```
{'content': 'Hi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}}
{'content': 'Hi this is Molly', 'metadata': {'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}}
```

Let's have a look at some examples below.

### Basic usage:


```python
pip install -qU langchain-text-splitters
```

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter
```

```python
markdown_document = "# Foo\n\n    ## Bar\n\nHi this is Jim\n\nHi this is Joe\n\n ### Boo \n\n Hi this is Lance \n\n ## Baz\n\n Hi this is Molly"

headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
    ("###", "Header 3"),
]

markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)
md_header_splits
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}, page_content='Hi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}, page_content='Hi this is Lance'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}, page_content='Hi this is Molly')]
```

```python
type(md_header_splits[0])
```

```output
langchain_core.documents.base.Document
```

By default, `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` strips headers being split on from the output chunk's content. This can be disabled by setting `strip_headers = False`.

```python
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(headers_to_split_on, strip_headers=False)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)
md_header_splits
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}, page_content='# Foo  \n## Bar  \nHi this is Jim  \nHi this is Joe'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}, page_content='### Boo  \nHi this is Lance'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}, page_content='## Baz  \nHi this is Molly')]
```

<Note>
    **The default `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` strips white spaces and new lines. To preserve the original formatting of your Markdown documents, check out [`ExperimentalMarkdownSyntaxTextSplitter`](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/text_splitters/markdown/langchain_text_splitters.markdown.ExperimentalMarkdownSyntaxTextSplitter.html).**
</Note>

### How to return Markdown lines as separate documents

By default, `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter` aggregates lines based on the headers specified in `headers_to_split_on`. We can disable this by specifying `return_each_line`:

```python
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on,
    return_each_line=True,
)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)
md_header_splits
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}, page_content='Hi this is Jim'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar'}, page_content='Hi this is Joe'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Bar', 'Header 3': 'Boo'}, page_content='Hi this is Lance'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Foo', 'Header 2': 'Baz'}, page_content='Hi this is Molly')]
```

Note that here header information is retained in the `metadata` for each document.

### How to constrain chunk size:

Within each markdown group we can then apply any text splitter we want, such as `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which allows for further control of the chunk size.

```python
markdown_document = "# Intro \n\n    ## History \n\n Markdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9] \n\n Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files. \n\n ## Rise and divergence \n\n As Markdown popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for \n\n additional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists,[note 1] and Markdown inside HTML blocks. \n\n #### Standardization \n\n From 2012, a group of people, including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane, launched what Atwood characterised as a standardisation effort. \n\n ## Implementations \n\n Implementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages."

headers_to_split_on = [
    ("#", "Header 1"),
    ("##", "Header 2"),
]

# MD splits
markdown_splitter = MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter(
    headers_to_split_on=headers_to_split_on, strip_headers=False
)
md_header_splits = markdown_splitter.split_text(markdown_document)

# Char-level splits
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

chunk_size = 250
chunk_overlap = 30
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap
)

# Split
splits = text_splitter.split_documents(md_header_splits)
splits
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Intro', 'Header 2': 'History'}, page_content='# Intro  \n## History  \nMarkdown[9] is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its source code form.[9]'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Intro', 'Header 2': 'History'}, page_content='Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Intro', 'Header 2': 'Rise and divergence'}, page_content='## Rise and divergence  \nAs Markdown popularity grew rapidly, many Markdown implementations appeared, driven mostly by the need for  \nadditional features such as tables, footnotes, definition lists,[note 1] and Markdown inside HTML blocks.'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Intro', 'Header 2': 'Rise and divergence'}, page_content='#### Standardization  \nFrom 2012, a group of people, including Jeff Atwood and John MacFarlane, launched what Atwood characterised as a standardisation effort.'),
 Document(metadata={'Header 1': 'Intro', 'Header 2': 'Implementations'}, page_content='## Implementations  \nImplementations of Markdown are available for over a dozen programming languages.')]
```

## Troubleshooting: `chunk_overlap` doesn't seem to apply

- After header-based splitting (e.g., `MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter`), use **`split_documents(docs)`** (not `split_text`) so that overlap is applied **within each section** and per-section metadata (headers) is preserved on chunks.
- Overlap appears only when a **single section** exceeds `chunk_size` and is split into multiple chunks.
- Overlap **does not cross** section/document boundaries (e.g., `# H1` â†’ `## H2`).
- If the header becomes a tiny first chunk, consider settubg `strip_headers` to `True` so the header line doesn't become a standalone chunk.
- If your text lacks newlines/spaces, keep a fallback `""` in `separators` so the splitter can still split and apply overlap.
