title: CassandraByteStore
---

This will help you get started with Cassandra [key-value stores](/oss/integrations/stores). For detailed documentation of all `CassandraByteStore` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/community/storage/langchain_community.storage.cassandra.CassandraByteStore.html).

## Overview

[Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is a NoSQL, row-oriented, highly scalable and highly available database.

## Setup

The `CassandraByteStore` is an implementation of `ByteStore` that stores the data in your Cassandra instance.
The store keys must be strings and will be mapped to the `row_id` column of the Cassandra table.
The store `bytes` values are mapped to the `body_blob` column of the Cassandra table.

### Installation

The LangChain `CassandraByteStore` integration lives in the `langchain-community` package. You'll also need to install the `cassio` package or the `cassandra-driver` package as a peer dependency depending on which initialization method you're using:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
pip install -qU cassandra-driver
pip install -qU cassio
```

You'll also need to create a `cassandra.cluster.Session` object, as described in the [Cassandra driver documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/cluster/#module-cassandra.cluster). The details vary (e.g. with network settings and authentication), but this might be something like:

## Instantiation

You'll first need to create a `cassandra.cluster.Session` object, as described in the [Cassandra driver documentation](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/python-driver/latest/api/cassandra/cluster/#module-cassandra.cluster). The details vary (e.g. with network settings and authentication), but this might be something like:

```python
from cassandra.cluster import Cluster

cluster = Cluster()
session = cluster.connect()
```

Then you can create your store! You'll also need to provide the name of an existing keyspace of the Cassandra instance:

```python
from langchain_community.storage import CassandraByteStore

kv_store = CassandraByteStore(
    table="my_store",
    session=session,
    keyspace="<YOUR KEYSPACE>",
)
```

## Usage

You can set data under keys like this using the `mset` method:

```python
kv_store.mset(
    [
        ["key1", b"value1"],
        ["key2", b"value2"],
    ]
)

kv_store.mget(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)
```

And you can delete data using the `mdelete` method:

```python
kv_store.mdelete(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)

kv_store.mget(
    [
        "key1",
        "key2",
    ]
)
```

## Init using `cassio`

It's also possible to use cassio to configure the session and keyspace.

```python
import cassio

cassio.init(contact_points="127.0.0.1", keyspace="<YOUR KEYSPACE>")

store = CassandraByteStore(
    table="my_store",
)

store.mset([("k1", b"v1"), ("k2", b"v2")])
print(store.mget(["k1", "k2"]))
```
