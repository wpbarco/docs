This notebook shows how to use the Slack chat loader. This class helps map exported slack conversations to LangChain chat messages.

The process has three steps:

1. Export the desired conversation thread by following the [instructions here](https://slack.com/help/articles/1500001548241-Request-to-export-all-conversations).
2. Create the `SlackChatLoader` with the file path pointed to the json file or directory of JSON files
3. Call `loader.load()` (or `loader.lazy_load()`) to perform the conversion. Optionally use `merge_chat_runs` to combine message from the same sender in sequence, and/or `map_ai_messages` to convert messages from the specified sender to the "AIMessage" class.

## 1. Create message dump

Currently (2023/08/23), this loader best supports a zip directory of files in the format generated by exporting your a direct message conversation from Slack. Follow the up-to-date instructions from slack on how to do so.

We have an example in the LangChain repo.

```python
import requests

permalink = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langchain-ai/langchain/342087bdfa3ac31d622385d0f2d09cf5e06c8db3/libs/langchain/tests/integration_tests/examples/slack_export.zip"
response = requests.get(permalink)
with open("slack_dump.zip", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

## 2. Create the Chat Loader

Provide the loader with the file path to the zip directory. You can optionally specify the user id that maps to an ai message as well as configure whether to merge message runs.

```python
from langchain_community.chat_loaders.slack import SlackChatLoader
```

```python
loader = SlackChatLoader(
    path="slack_dump.zip",
)
```

## 3. Load messages

The `load()` (or `lazy_load`) methods return a list of "ChatSessions" that currently just contain a list of messages per loaded conversation.

```python
from typing import List

from langchain_community.chat_loaders.utils import (
    map_ai_messages,
    merge_chat_runs,
)
from langchain_core.chat_sessions import ChatSession

raw_messages = loader.lazy_load()
# Merge consecutive messages from the same sender into a single message
merged_messages = merge_chat_runs(raw_messages)
# Convert messages from "U0500003428" to AI messages
messages: List[ChatSession] = list(
    map_ai_messages(merged_messages, sender="U0500003428")
)
```

### Next steps

You can then use these messages how you see fit, such as fine-tuning a model, few-shot example selection, or directly make predictions for the next message.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI()

for chunk in llm.stream(messages[1]["messages"]):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
```

Hi,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and ask if you'd be available to meet up for coffee sometime next week. I'd love to catch up and hear about what's been going on in your life. Let me know if you're interested and we can find a time that works for both of us.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Best, [Your Name]
