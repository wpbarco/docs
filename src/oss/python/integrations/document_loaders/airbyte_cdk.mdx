title: Airbyte CDK (Deprecated)
---

Note: `AirbyteCDKLoader` is deprecated. Please use [`AirbyteLoader`](/oss/integrations/document_loaders/airbyte) instead.

>[Airbyte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte) is a data integration platform for ELT pipelines from APIs, databases & files to warehouses & lakes. It has the largest catalog of ELT connectors to data warehouses and databases.

A lot of source connectors are implemented using the [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.com/connector-development/cdk-python/). This loader allows to run any of these connectors and return the data as documents.

## Installation

First, you need to install the `airbyte-cdk` python package.

```python
pip install -qU  airbyte-cdk
```

Then, either install an existing connector from the [Airbyte Github repository](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/tree/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors) or create your own connector using the [Airbyte CDK](https://docs.airbyte.io/connector-development/connector-development).

For example, to install the Github connector, run

```python
pip install -qU  "source_github@git+https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte.git@master#subdirectory=airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-github"
```

Some sources are also published as regular packages on PyPI

## Example

Now you can create an `AirbyteCDKLoader` based on the imported source. It takes a `config` object that's passed to the connector. You also have to pick the stream you want to retrieve records from by name (`stream_name`). Check the connectors documentation page and spec definition for more information on the config object and available streams. For the Github connectors these are:

* [https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-github/source_github/spec.json](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/blob/master/airbyte-integrations/connectors/source-github/source_github/spec.json).
* [https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/github/](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/github/)

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.airbyte import AirbyteCDKLoader
from source_github.source import SourceGithub  # plug in your own source here

config = {
    # your github configuration
    "credentials": {"api_url": "api.github.com", "personal_access_token": "<token>"},
    "repository": "<repo>",
    "start_date": "<date from which to start retrieving records from in ISO format, e.g. 2020-10-20T00:00:00Z>",
}

issues_loader = AirbyteCDKLoader(
    source_class=SourceGithub, config=config, stream_name="issues"
)
```

Now you can load documents the usual way

```python
docs = issues_loader.load()
```

As `load` returns a list, it will block until all documents are loaded. To have better control over this process, you can also use the `lazy_load` method which returns an iterator instead:

```python
docs_iterator = issues_loader.lazy_load()
```

Keep in mind that by default the page content is empty and the metadata object contains all the information from the record. To create documents in a different way, pass in a record_handler function when creating the loader:

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document


def handle_record(record, id):
    return Document(
        page_content=record.data["title"] + "\n" + (record.data["body"] or ""),
        metadata=record.data,
    )


issues_loader = AirbyteCDKLoader(
    source_class=SourceGithub,
    config=config,
    stream_name="issues",
    record_handler=handle_record,
)

docs = issues_loader.load()
```

## Incremental loads

Some streams allow incremental loading, this means the source keeps track of synced records and won't load them again. This is useful for sources that have a high volume of data and are updated frequently.

To take advantage of this, store the `last_state` property of the loader and pass it in when creating the loader again. This will ensure that only new records are loaded.

```python
last_state = issues_loader.last_state  # store safely

incremental_issue_loader = AirbyteCDKLoader(
    source_class=SourceGithub, config=config, stream_name="issues", state=last_state
)

new_docs = incremental_issue_loader.load()
```
