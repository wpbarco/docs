>[Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/products/cos) is a distributed
> storage service that enables you to store any amount of data from anywhere via HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
> `COS` has no restrictions on data structure or format. It also has no bucket size limit and
> partition management, making it suitable for virtually any use case, such as data delivery,
> data processing, and data lakes. `COS` provides a web-based console, multi-language SDKs and APIs,
> command line tool, and graphical tools. It works well with Amazon S3 APIs, allowing you to quickly
> access community tools and plugins.
