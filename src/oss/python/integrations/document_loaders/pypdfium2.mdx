 'source': './example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf',
 'total_pages': 16,
 'page': 10}
```

The metadata attribute contains at least the following keys:

- source
- page (if in mode *page*)
- total_page
- creationdate
- creator
- producer

Additional metadata are specific to each parser.
These pieces of information can be helpful (to categorize your PDFs for example).

## Splitting mode & custom pages delimiter

When loading the PDF file you can split it in two different ways:

- By page
- As a single text flow

By default PyPDFLoader will split the PDF as a single text flow.

### Extract the PDF by page. Each page is extracted as a langchain Document object

```python
loader = PyPDFium2Loader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",
    mode="page",
)
docs = loader.load()
print(len(docs))
pprint.pp(docs[0].metadata)
```

```output
16
{'title': '',
 'author': '',
 'subject': '',
 'keywords': '',
 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref',
 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21',
 'creationdate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00',
 'moddate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00',
 'source': './example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf',
 'total_pages': 16,
 'page': 0}
```

In this mode the pdf is split by pages and the resulting Documents metadata contains the page number. But in some cases we could want to process the pdf as a single text flow (so we don't cut some paragraphs in half). In this case you can use the *single* mode :

### Extract the whole PDF as a single langchain Document object

```python
loader = PyPDFium2Loader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",
    mode="single",
)
docs = loader.load()
print(len(docs))
pprint.pp(docs[0].metadata)
```

```output
1
{'title': '',
 'author': '',
 'subject': '',
 'keywords': '',
 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref',
 'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.21',
 'creationdate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00',
 'moddate': '2021-06-22T01:27:10+00:00',
 'source': './example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf',
 'total_pages': 16}
```

Logically, in this mode, the ‘page_number’ metadata disappears. Here's how to clearly identify where pages end in the text flow :

### Add a custom *pages_delimiter* to identify where are ends of pages in *single* mode

```python
loader = PyPDFium2Loader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",
    mode="single",
    pages_delimiter="\n-------THIS IS A CUSTOM END OF PAGE-------\n",
)
docs = loader.load()
print(docs[0].page_content[:5780])
```

1 Introduction
Deep Learning(DL)-based approaches are the state-of-the-art for a wide range of
document image analysis (DIA) tasks including document image classification [11,
arXiv:2103.15348v2 [cs.CV] 21 Jun 2021

37], layout detection [38, 22], table detection [26], and scene text detection [4].
A generalized learning-based framework dramatically reduces the need for the
manual specification of complicated rules, which is the status quo with traditional
methods. DL has the potential to transform DIA pipelines and benefit a broad
spectrum of large-scale document digitization projects.
However, there are several practical difficulties for taking advantages of recent advances in DL-based methods: 1) DL models are notoriously convoluted
for reuse and extension. Existing models are developed using distinct frameworks like TensorFlow [1] or PyTorch [24], and the high-level parameters can
be obfuscated by implementation details [8]. It can be a time-consuming and
frustrating experience to debug, reproduce, and adapt existing models for DIA,
and many researchers who would benefit the most from using these methods lack
the technical background to implement them from scratch. 2) Document images
contain diverse and disparate patterns across domains, and customized training
is often required to achieve a desirable detection accuracy. Currently there is no
full-fledged infrastructure for easily curating the target document image datasets
and fine-tuning or re-training the models. 3) DIA usually requires a sequence of
models and other processing to obtain the final outputs. Often research teams use
DL models and then perform further document analyses in separate processes,
and these pipelines are not documented in any central location (and often not
documented at all). This makes it difficult for research teams to learn about how
full pipelines are implemented and leads them to invest significant resources in
reinventing the DIA wheel.
LayoutParser provides a unified toolkit to support DL-based document image
analysis and processing. To address the aforementioned challenges, LayoutParser
is built with the following components:
1. An off-the-shelf toolkit for applying DL models for layout detection, character
recognition, and other DIA tasks (Section 3)
2. A rich repository of pre-trained neural network models (Model Zoo) that
underlies the off-the-shelf usage
3. Comprehensive tools for efficient document image data annotation and model
tuning to support different levels of customization
4. A DL model hub and community platform for the easy sharing, distribution, and discussion of DIA models and pipelines, to promote reusability,
reproducibility, and extensibility (Section 4)
The library implements simple and intuitive Python APIs without sacrificing
generalizability and versatility, and can be easily installed via pip. Its convenient
functions for handling document image data can be seamlessly integrated with
existing DIA pipelines. With detailed documentations and carefully curated
tutorials, we hope this tool will benefit a variety of end-users, and will lead to
advances in applications in both industry and academic research.
LayoutParser is well aligned with recent efforts for improving DL model
reusability in other disciplines like natural language processing [8, 34] and computer vision [35], but with a focus on unique challenges in DIA. We show
LayoutParser can be applied in sophisticated and large-scale digitization projects

# Extract images from the PDF

You can extract images from your PDFs with a choice of three different solutions:

- rapidOCR (lightweight Optical Character Recognition tool)
- Tesseract (OCR tool with high precision)
- Multimodal language model

You can tune these functions to choose the output format of the extracted images among *html*, *markdown* or *text*

The result is inserted between the last and the second-to-last paragraphs of text of the page.

### Extract images from the PDF with rapidOCR

```python
pip install -qU rapidocr-onnxruntime
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders.parsers import RapidOCRBlobParser

loader = PyPDFium2Loader(
    "./example_data/layout-parser-paper.pdf",
    mode="page",
    images_inner_format="markdown-img",
    images_parser=RapidOCRBlobParser(),
)
docs = loader.load()

print(docs[5].page_content)
```

```output

Fig. 2: The relationship between the three types of layout data structures.
Coordinate supports three kinds of variation; TextBlock consists of the coordinate information and extra features like block text, types, and reading orders;
a Layout object is a list of all possible layout elements, including other Layout
objects. They all support the same set of transformation and operation APIs for
maximum flexibility.
Shown in Table 1, LayoutParser currently hosts 9 pre-trained models trained
on 5 different datasets. Description of the training dataset is provided alongside
with the trained models such that users can quickly identify the most suitable
models for their tasks. Additionally, when such a model is not readily available,
LayoutParser also supports training customized layout models and community
sharing of the models (detailed in Section 3.5).
3.2 Layout Data Structures
A critical feature of LayoutParser is the implementation of a series of data
structures and operations that can be used to efficiently process and manipulate
the layout elements. In document image analysis pipelines, various post-processing
on the layout analysis model outputs is usually required to obtain the final
outputs. Traditionally, this requires exporting DL model outputs and then loading
the results into other pipelines. All model outputs from LayoutParser will be
stored in carefully engineered data types optimized for further processing, which
makes it possible to build an end-to-end document digitization pipeline within
LayoutParser. There are three key components in the data structure, namely
the Coordinate system, the TextBlock, and the Layout. They provide different
levels of abstraction for the layout data, and a set of APIs are supported for
transformations or operations on these classes.

## Working with Files

Many document loaders involve parsing files. The difference between such loaders usually stems from how the file is parsed, rather than how the file is loaded. For example, you can use `open` to read the binary content of either a PDF or a markdown file, but you need different parsing logic to convert that binary data into text.

As a result, it can be helpful to decouple the parsing logic from the loading logic, which makes it easier to re-use a given parser regardless of how the data was loaded.
You can use this strategy to analyze different files, with the same parsing parameters.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import FileSystemBlobLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders.generic import GenericLoader
from langchain_community.document_loaders.parsers import PyPDFium2Parser

loader = GenericLoader(
    blob_loader=FileSystemBlobLoader(
        path="./example_data/",
        glob="*.pdf",
    ),
    blob_parser=PyPDFium2Parser(),
)
docs = loader.load()
print(docs[0].page_content)
pprint.pp(docs[0].metadata)
