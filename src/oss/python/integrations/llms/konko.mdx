>[Konko](https://www.konko.ai/) API is a fully managed Web API designed to help application developers:

1. **Select** the right open source or proprietary LLMs for their application
2. **Build** applications faster with integrations to leading application frameworks and fully managed APIs
3. **Fine tune** smaller open-source LLMs to achieve industry-leading performance at a fraction of the cost
4. **Deploy production-scale APIs** that meet security, privacy, throughput, and latency SLAs without infrastructure set-up or administration using Konko AI's SOC 2 compliant, multi-cloud infrastructure

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with `Konko` completion [models](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models#konko-hosted-models-for-completion)

To run this notebook, you'll need Konko API key. Sign in to our web app to [create an API key](https://platform.konko.ai/settings/api-keys) to access models

#### Set environment variables

1. You can set environment variables for
    1. KONKO_API_KEY (Required)
    2. OPENAI_API_KEY (Optional)
2. In your current shell session, use the export command:

```shell
export KONKO_API_KEY={your_KONKO_API_KEY_here}
export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_OPENAI_API_KEY_here} #Optional
```

## Calling a model

Find a model on the [Konko overview page](https://docs.konko.ai/docs/list-of-models)

Another way to find the list of models running on the Konko instance is through this [endpoint](https://docs.konko.ai/reference/get-models).

From here, we can initialize our model:

```python
from langchain_community.llms import Konko

llm = Konko(model="mistralai/mistral-7b-v0.1", temperature=0.1, max_tokens=128)

input_ = """You are a helpful assistant. Explain Big Bang Theory briefly."""
print(llm.invoke(input_))
```

```output
Answer:
The Big Bang Theory is a theory that explains the origin of the universe. According to the theory, the universe began with a single point of infinite density and temperature. This point is called the singularity. The singularity exploded and expanded rapidly. The expansion of the universe is still continuing.
