title: OpenLM
---

[OpenLM](https://github.com/r2d4/openlm) is a zero-dependency OpenAI-compatible LLM provider that can call different inference endpoints directly via HTTP.

It implements the OpenAI Completion class so that it can be used as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API. This changeset utilizes BaseOpenAI for minimal added code.

This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with both OpenAI and HuggingFace. You'll need API keys from both.

### Setup

Install dependencies and set API keys.

```python
# Uncomment to install openlm and openai if you haven't already

pip install -qU  openlm
pip install -qU  langchain-openai
```

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass

# Check if OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is set
if "OPENAI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    print("Enter your OpenAI API key:")
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass()

# Check if HF_API_TOKEN environment variable is set
if "HF_API_TOKEN" not in os.environ:
    print("Enter your HuggingFace Hub API key:")
    os.environ["HF_API_TOKEN"] = getpass()
```

### Using LangChain with OpenLM

Here we're going to call two models in an LLMChain, `text-davinci-003` from OpenAI and `gpt2` on HuggingFace.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain_community.llms import OpenLM
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
```

```python
question = "What is the capital of France?"
template = """Question: {question}

Answer: Let's think step by step."""

prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

for model in ["text-davinci-003", "huggingface.co/gpt2"]:
    llm = OpenLM(model=model)
    llm_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
    result = llm_chain.run(question)
    print(
        """Model: {}
Result: {}""".format(model, result)
    )
```

```output
Model: text-davinci-003
Result:  France is a country in Europe. The capital of France is Paris.
Model: huggingface.co/gpt2
Result: Question: What is the capital of France?

Answer: Let's think step by step. I am not going to lie, this is a complicated issue, and I don't see any solutions to all this, but it is still far more
```
