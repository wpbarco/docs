## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install langchain-timbr`

###  Optional: Install with selected LLM provider

Choose one of: openai, anthropic, google, azure_openai, snowflake, databricks, vertex_ai (or 'all')

```bash
pip install 'langchain-timbr[<your selected providers, separated by comma without spaces>]'
```

## Semantic SQL Queries

There exists a wrapper around Timbr's semantic layer that allows you to generate SQL statements based on natural language input and use them to retrieve relevant information from your knowledge graph.

```python
from langchain_timbr import create_timbr_sql_agent, ExecuteTimbrQueryChain, GenerateTimbrSqlChain
```
