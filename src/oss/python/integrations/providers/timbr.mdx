## Installation and Setup

- Install the Python SDK with `pip install langchain-timbr`

### Optional: Install with selected LLM provider

## Semantic SQL Queries

Timbr provides a wrapper around its semantic layer that generates SQL statements based on natural language input and retrieves relevant information from your knowledge graph.

```python
from langchain_timbr import create_timbr_sql_agent, ExecuteTimbrQueryChain, GenerateTimbrSqlChain
```
