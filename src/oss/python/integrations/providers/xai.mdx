[xAI](https://console.x.ai) offers an API to interact with Grok models. This example goes over how to use LangChain to interact with xAI models.

## Installation

```python
pip install -U langchain-xai
```

## Environment

To use xAI, you'll need to [create an API key](https://console.x.ai/). The API key can be passed in as an init param `xai_api_key` or set as environment variable `XAI_API_KEY`.

## Example

See [ChatXAI docs](/oss/integrations/chat/xai) for detail and supported features.

```python
# Querying chat models with xAI

from langchain_xai import ChatXAI

chat = ChatXAI(
    # xai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    model="grok-4",
)

# stream the response back from the model
for m in chat.stream("Tell me fun things to do in NYC"):
    print(m.content, end="", flush=True)

# if you don't want to do streaming, you can use the invoke method
# chat.invoke("Tell me fun things to do in NYC")
```
