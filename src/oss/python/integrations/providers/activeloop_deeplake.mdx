title: Activeloop Deep Lake
---

>[Activeloop Deep Lake](https://docs.activeloop.ai/) is a data lake for Deep Learning applications, allowing you to use it
> as a vector store.

## Why Deep Lake?

- More than just a (multi-modal) vector store. You can later use the dataset to fine-tune your own LLM models.
- Not only stores embeddings, but also the original data with automatic version control.
- Truly serverless. Doesn't require another service and can be used with major cloud providers (`AWS S3`, `GCS`, etc.)
