**LangGraph v1 is a stability-focused release for the agent runtime.** It keeps the core graph APIs and execution model unchanged, while refining type safety, docs, and developer ergonomics.

It's designed to work hand-in-hand with [LangChain v1](/oss/releases/langchain-v1) (whose `create_agent` is built on LangGraph) so you can start high-level and drop down to granular control when needed.

        Graph primitives (state, nodes, edges) and the execution/runtime model are unchanged, making upgrades straightforward.

    <Card title="Reliability, by default" icon="database">
        Durable execution with checkpointing, persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop continues to be first-class.

    <Card title="Seamless with LangChain v1" icon="link">
        LangChain's `create_agent` runs on LangGraph. Use LangChain for a fast start; drop to LangGraph for custom orchestration.

To upgrade,

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U langgraph
```
```bash uv
uv add langgraph
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deprecation of `create_react_agent`

The LangGraph @[`create_react_agent`] prebuilt has been deprecated in favor of LangChain's @[`create_agent`]. It provides a simpler interface, and offers greater customization potential through the introduction of middleware.

* For information on the new @[`create_agent`] API, see the [LangChain v1 release notes](/oss/releases/langchain-v1#create-agent).
* For information on migrating from @[`create_react_agent`] to @[`create_agent`], see the [LangChain v1 migration guide](/oss/migrate/langchain-v1#create-agent).
