<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of [text completion models](/oss/concepts/text_llms). Many of the latest and most popular models are [chat completion models](/oss/concepts/chat_models).**


Unless you are specifically using more advanced prompting techniques, you are probably looking for [this page instead](/oss/integrations/chat/).
</Warning>

[LLMs](docs/concepts/#llms) are language models that takes a string as input and return a string as output.

<Info>
If you'd like to write your own LLM, see [this how-to](/oss/how-to/custom_llm). If you'd like to contribute an integration, see [Contributing integrations](/docs/contributing).
