# How to use multimodal prompts

Here we demonstrate how to use prompt templates to format multimodal inputs to models. 

In this example we will ask a model to describe an image.

**Prerequisites**


This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/oss/concepts/chat_models)
- [LangChain Tools](/oss/concepts/tools)

```{=mdx}
import Npm2Yarn from "@theme/Npm2Yarn"

<Npm2Yarn>
  axios @langchain/openai @langchain/core
</Npm2Yarn>
```
```typescript
import axios from "axios";

const imageUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg";
const axiosRes = await axios.get(imageUrl, { responseType: "arraybuffer" });
const base64 = btoa(
  new Uint8Array(axiosRes.data).reduce(
    (data, byte) => data + String.fromCharCode(byte),
    ''
  )
);
```


```typescript
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4o" })
```


```typescript
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(
    [
        ["system", "Describe the image provided"],
        [
            "user",
            [{ type: "image_url", image_url: "data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64}" }],
        ]
    ]
)
```


```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(model);
```


```typescript
const response = await chain.invoke({ base64 })
console.log(response.content)
```
```output
The image depicts a scenic outdoor landscape featuring a wooden boardwalk path extending forward through a large field of green grass and vegetation. On either side of the path, the grass is lush and vibrant, with a variety of bushes and low shrubs visible as well. The sky overhead is expansive and mostly clear, adorned with soft, wispy clouds, illuminated by the light giving a warm and serene ambiance. In the distant background, there are clusters of trees and additional foliage, suggesting a natural and tranquil setting, ideal for a peaceful walk or nature exploration.
```
We can also pass in multiple images.


```typescript
const promptWithMultipleImages = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(
    [
        ["system", "compare the two pictures provided"],
        [
            "user",
            [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,{imageData1}",
                },
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,{imageData2}",
                },
            ],
        ],
    ]
)
```


```typescript
const chainWithMultipleImages = promptWithMultipleImages.pipe(model);
```


```typescript
const res = await chainWithMultipleImages.invoke({ imageData1: base64, imageData2: base64 })
console.log(res.content)
```
```output
The two images provided are identical. Both show a wooden boardwalk path extending into a grassy field under a blue sky with scattered clouds. The scenery includes green shrubs and trees in the background, with a bright and clear sky above.
```
