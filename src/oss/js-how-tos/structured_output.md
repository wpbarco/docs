# How to return structured data from a model
```{=mdx}
<span data-heading-keywords="with_structured_output"></span>
```
It is often useful to have a model return output that matches some specific schema. One common use-case is extracting data from arbitrary text to insert into a traditional database or use with some other downstream system. This guide will show you a few different strategies you can use to do this.

This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

## The `.withStructuredOutput()` method

There are several strategies that models can use under the hood. For some of the most popular model providers, including [Anthropic](/oss/integrations/platforms/anthropic/), [Google VertexAI](/oss/integrations/platforms/google/), [Mistral](/oss/integrations/chat/mistral/), and [OpenAI](/oss/integrations/platforms/openai/) LangChain implements a common interface that abstracts away these strategies called `.withStructuredOutput`.

By invoking this method (and passing in [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) or a [Zod schema](https://zod.dev/)) the model will add whatever model parameters + output parsers are necessary to get back structured output matching the requested schema. If the model supports more than one way to do this (e.g., function calling vs JSON mode) - you can configure which method to use by passing into that method.

Let's look at some examples of this in action! We'll use Zod to create a simple response schema.

```{=mdx}
<ChatModelTabs onlyWso={true} />
```
```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

const joke = z.object({
  setup: z.string().describe("The setup of the joke"),
  punchline: z.string().describe("The punchline to the joke"),
  rating: z.number().optional().describe("How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10"),
});

const structuredLlm = model.withStructuredOutput(joke);

await structuredLlm.invoke("Tell me a joke about cats")
```



```output
{
  setup: "Why don't cats play poker in the wild?",
  punchline: "Too many cheetahs.",
  rating: 7
}
```


One key point is that though we set our Zod schema as a variable named `joke`, Zod is not able to access that variable name, and therefore cannot pass it to the model. Though it is not required, we can pass a name for our schema in order to give the model additional context as to what our schema represents, improving performance:


```typescript
const structuredLlm = model.withStructuredOutput(joke, { name: "joke" });

await structuredLlm.invoke("Tell me a joke about cats")
```



```output
{
  setup: "Why don't cats play poker in the wild?",
  punchline: "Too many cheetahs!",
  rating: 7
}
```


The result is a JSON object.

We can also pass in an OpenAI-style JSON schema dict if you prefer not to use Zod. This object should contain three properties:

- `name`: The name of the schema to output.
- `description`: A high level description of the schema to output.
- `parameters`: The nested details of the schema you want to extract, formatted as a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) dict.

In this case, the response is also a dict:


```typescript
const structuredLlm = model.withStructuredOutput(
  {
    "name": "joke",
    "description": "Joke to tell user.",
    "parameters": {
      "title": "Joke",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "setup": {"type": "string", "description": "The setup for the joke"},
        "punchline": {"type": "string", "description": "The joke's punchline"},
      },
      "required": ["setup", "punchline"],
    },
  }
)

await structuredLlm.invoke("Tell me a joke about cats", { name: "joke" })
```



```output
{
  setup: "Why was the cat sitting on the computer?",
  punchline: "Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!"
}
```


If you are using JSON Schema, you can take advantage of other more complex schema descriptions to create a similar effect.

You can also use tool calling directly to allow the model to choose between options, if your chosen model supports it. This involves a bit more parsing and setup. See [this how-to guide](/oss/how-to/tool_calling/) for more details.

### Specifying the output method (Advanced)

For models that support more than one means of outputting data, you can specify the preferred one like this:


```typescript
const structuredLlm = model.withStructuredOutput(joke, {
  method: "json_mode",
  name: "joke",
})

await structuredLlm.invoke(
  "Tell me a joke about cats, respond in JSON with `setup` and `punchline` keys"
)
```



```output
{
  setup: "Why don't cats play poker in the jungle?",
  punchline: "Too many cheetahs!"
}
```


In the above example, we use OpenAI's alternate JSON mode capability along with a more specific prompt.

For specifics about the model you choose, peruse its entry in the [API reference pages](https://api.js.langchain.com/).

### (Advanced) Raw outputs

LLMs aren't perfect at generating structured output, especially as schemas become complex. You can avoid raising exceptions and handle the raw output yourself by passing `includeRaw: true`. This changes the output format to contain the raw message output and the `parsed` value (if successful):


```typescript
const joke = z.object({
  setup: z.string().describe("The setup of the joke"),
  punchline: z.string().describe("The punchline to the joke"),
  rating: z.number().optional().describe("How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10"),
});

const structuredLlm = model.withStructuredOutput(joke, { includeRaw: true, name: "joke" });

await structuredLlm.invoke("Tell me a joke about cats");
```



```output
{
  raw: AIMessage {
    lc_serializable: true,
    lc_kwargs: {
      content: "",
      tool_calls: [
        {
          name: "joke",
          args: [Object],
          id: "call_0pEdltlfSXjq20RaBFKSQOeF"
        }
      ],
      invalid_tool_calls: [],
      additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: [ [Object] ] },
      response_metadata: {}
    },
    lc_namespace: [ "langchain_core", "messages" ],
    content: "",
    name: undefined,
    additional_kwargs: {
      function_call: undefined,
      tool_calls: [
        {
          id: "call_0pEdltlfSXjq20RaBFKSQOeF",
          type: "function",
          function: [Object]
        }
      ]
    },
    response_metadata: {
      tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 33, promptTokens: 88, totalTokens: 121 },
      finish_reason: "stop"
    },
    tool_calls: [
      {
        name: "joke",
        args: {
          setup: "Why was the cat sitting on the computer?",
          punchline: "Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!",
          rating: 7
        },
        id: "call_0pEdltlfSXjq20RaBFKSQOeF"
      }
    ],
    invalid_tool_calls: [],
    usage_metadata: { input_tokens: 88, output_tokens: 33, total_tokens: 121 }
  },
  parsed: {
    setup: "Why was the cat sitting on the computer?",
    punchline: "Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!",
    rating: 7
  }
}
```


## Prompting techniques

You can also prompt models to outputting information in a given format. This approach relies on designing good prompts and then parsing the output of the models. This is the only option for models that don't support `.with_structured_output()` or other built-in approaches.

### Using `JsonOutputParser`

The following example uses the built-in [`JsonOutputParser`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_core.output_parsers.JsonOutputParser.html) to parse the output of a chat model prompted to match a the given JSON schema. Note that we are adding `format_instructions` directly to the prompt from a method on the parser:


```typescript
import { JsonOutputParser } from "@langchain/core/output_parsers";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

type Person = {
    name: string;
    height_in_meters: number;
};

type People = {
    people: Person[];
};

const formatInstructions = `Respond only in valid JSON. The JSON object you return should match the following schema:
{{ people: [{{ name: "string", height_in_meters: "number" }}] }}

Where people is an array of objects, each with a name and height_in_meters field.
`

// Set up a parser
const parser = new JsonOutputParser<People>();

// Prompt
const prompt = await ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(
    [
        [
            "system",
            "Answer the user query. Wrap the output in `json` tags\n{format_instructions}",
        ],
        [
            "human",
            "{query}",
        ]
    ]
).partial({
    format_instructions: formatInstructions,
})
```

Let’s take a look at what information is sent to the model:


```typescript
const query = "Anna is 23 years old and she is 6 feet tall"

console.log((await prompt.format({ query })).toString())
```
```output
System: Answer the user query. Wrap the output in `json` tags
Respond only in valid JSON. The JSON object you return should match the following schema:
{{ people: [{{ name: "string", height_in_meters: "number" }}] }}

Where people is an array of objects, each with a name and height_in_meters field.

Human: Anna is 23 years old and she is 6 feet tall
```
And now let's invoke it:


```typescript
const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(parser);

await chain.invoke({ query })
```



```output
{ people: [ { name: "Anna", height_in_meters: 1.83 } ] }
```


For a deeper dive into using output parsers with prompting techniques for structured output, see [this guide](/oss/how-to/output_parser_structured).

### Custom Parsing

You can also create a custom prompt and parser with [LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)](/oss/concepts/lcel), using a plain function to parse the output from the model:


```typescript
import { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";
import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

type Person = {
    name: string;
    height_in_meters: number;
};

type People = {
    people: Person[];
};

const schema = `{{ people: [{{ name: "string", height_in_meters: "number" }}] }}`

// Prompt
const prompt = await ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages(
    [
        [
            "system",
            `Answer the user query. Output your answer as JSON that
matches the given schema: \`\`\`json\n{schema}\n\`\`\`.
Make sure to wrap the answer in \`\`\`json and \`\`\` tags`
        ],
        [
            "human",
            "{query}",
        ]
    ]
).partial({
    schema
});

/**
 * Custom extractor
 * 
 * Extracts JSON content from a string where
 * JSON is embedded between \`\`\`json and \`\`\` tags.
 */
const extractJson = (output: AIMessage): Array<People> => {
    const text = output.content as string;
    // Define the regular expression pattern to match JSON blocks
    const pattern = /\`\`\`json(.*?)\`\`\`/gs;

    // Find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string
    const matches = text.match(pattern);

    // Process each match, attempting to parse it as JSON
    try {
        return matches?.map(match => {
            // Remove the markdown code block syntax to isolate the JSON string
            const jsonStr = match.replace(/\`\`\`json|\`\`\`/g, '').trim();
            return JSON.parse(jsonStr);
        }) ?? [];
    } catch (error) {
        throw new Error(`Failed to parse: ${output}`);
    }
}
```

Here is the prompt sent to the model:


```typescript
const query = "Anna is 23 years old and she is 6 feet tall"

console.log((await prompt.format({ query })).toString())
```
```output
System: Answer the user query. Output your answer as JSON that
matches the given schema: \`\`\`json
{{ people: [{{ name: "string", height_in_meters: "number" }}] }}
\`\`\`.
Make sure to wrap the answer in \`\`\`json and \`\`\` tags
Human: Anna is 23 years old and she is 6 feet tall
```
And here's what it looks like when we invoke it:


```typescript
import { RunnableLambda } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const chain = prompt.pipe(model).pipe(new RunnableLambda({ func: extractJson }));

await chain.invoke({ query })
```



```output
[
  { people: [ { name: "Anna", height_in_meters: 1.83 } ] }
]
```
