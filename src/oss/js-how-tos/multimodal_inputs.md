# How to pass multimodal data directly to models

<Info>
**Prerequisites**


This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

- [Chat models](/oss/concepts/chat_models)

</Info>

Here we demonstrate how to pass multimodal input directly to models. 
We currently expect all input to be passed in the same format as [OpenAI expects](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision).
For other model providers that support multimodal input, we have added logic inside the class to convert to the expected format.

In this example we will ask a model to describe an image.


```typescript
import * as fs from "node:fs/promises";

import { ChatAnthropic } from "@langchain/anthropic";

const model = new ChatAnthropic({
  model: "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
});

const imageData = await fs.readFile("../../../../examples/hotdog.jpg");
```

The most commonly supported way to pass in images is to pass it in as a byte string within a message with a complex content type for models that support multimodal input. Here's an example:


```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const message = new HumanMessage({
  content: [
    {
      type: "text",
      text: "what does this image contain?"},
    {
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: {
        url: `data:image/jpeg;base64,${imageData.toString("base64")}`},
    },
  ],
})
const response = await model.invoke([message]);
console.log(response.content);
```
```output
This image contains a hot dog. It shows a frankfurter or sausage encased in a soft, elongated bread bun. The sausage itself appears to be reddish in color, likely a smoked or cured variety. The bun is a golden-brown color, suggesting it has been lightly toasted or grilled. The hot dog is presented against a plain white background, allowing the details of the iconic American fast food item to be clearly visible.
```
Some model providers support taking an HTTP URL to the image directly in a content block of type `"image_url"`:


```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const openAIModel = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o",
});

const imageUrl = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg";

const message = new HumanMessage({
  content: [
    {
      type: "text",
      text: "describe the weather in this image"},
    {
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: { url: imageUrl }
    },
  ],
});
const response = await openAIModel.invoke([message]);
console.log(response.content);
```
```output
The weather in the image appears to be pleasant and clear. The sky is mostly blue with a few scattered clouds, indicating good visibility and no immediate signs of rain. The lighting suggests it’s either morning or late afternoon, with sunlight creating a warm and bright atmosphere. There is no indication of strong winds, as the grass and foliage appear calm and undisturbed. Overall, it looks like a beautiful day, possibly spring or summer, ideal for outdoor activities.
```
We can also pass in multiple images.


```typescript
const message = new HumanMessage({
  content: [
    {
      type: "text",
      text: "are these two images the same?"
    },
    {
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: {
        url: imageUrl
      }
    },
    {
      type: "image_url",
      image_url: {
        url: imageUrl
      }
    },
  ],
});
const response = await openAIModel.invoke([message]);
console.log(response.content);
```
```output
Yes, the two images are the same.
```
