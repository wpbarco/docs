title: Splitting by character
---

Character-based splitting is the simplest approach to text splitting. It divides text using a specified character sequence (default: `"\n\n"`), with chunk length measured by the number of characters.

**Key points**:
1. **How text is split**: by a given character separator.
2. **How chunk size is measured**: by character count.

:::python
You can choose between:
- `.split_text` — returns plain string chunks.
- `.create_documents` — returns LangChain @[Document] objects, useful when metadata needs to be preserved for downstream tasks.

```python
metadatas = [{"document": 1}, {"document": 2}]
documents = text_splitter.create_documents(
