<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of Together AI models as text completion models. Many popular models available on Together AI are [chat completion models](/oss/langchain/models).**

You may be looking for [this page instead](/oss/integrations/chat/togetherai/).
</Warning>

[Together AI](https://www.together.ai/) offers an API to query [50+ leading open-source models](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-models) in a couple lines of code.

This will help you get started with Together AI text completion models (LLMs) using LangChain. For detailed documentation on `TogetherAI` features and configuration options, please refer to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_llms_togetherai.TogetherAI.html).

## Setup

To access `ChatTogetherAI` models you'll need to create a Together account, get an API key [here](https://api.together.xyz/), and install the `@langchain/community` integration package.

### Credentials

Head to [api.together.ai](https://api.together.ai/) to sign up to TogetherAI and generate an API key. Once you've done this set the `TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export TOGETHER_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```bash
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

The LangChain TogetherAI integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and generate chat completions:

```typescript
import { TogetherAI } from "@langchain/community/llms/togetherai";

const llm = new TogetherAI({
  model: "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Turbo",
  maxTokens: 256,
});
```

## Invocation

```typescript
const inputText = "Together is an AI company that "

const completion = await llm.invoke(inputText)
completion
```
