title: UpstashVectorStore
---

[Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/) is a REST based serverless vector database, designed for working with vector embeddings.

This guide provides a quick overview for getting started with Upstash [vector stores](/oss/integrations/vectorstores). For detailed documentation of all `UpstashVectorStore` features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_vectorstores_upstash.UpstashVectorStore.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | [PY support](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/upstash/) |  Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| [`UpstashVectorStore`](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_vectorstores_upstash.UpstashVectorStore.html) | [`@langchain/community`](https://npmjs.com/@langchain/community) | âœ… |  ![NPM - Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@langchain/community?style=flat-square&label=%20&) |

## Setup

To use Upstash vector stores, you'll need to create an Upstash account, create an index, and install the `@langchain/community` integration package. You'll also need to install the [`@upstash/vector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@upstash/vector) package as a peer dependency.

This guide will also use [OpenAI embeddings](/oss/integrations/text_embedding/openai), which require you to install the `@langchain/openai` integration package. You can also use [other supported embeddings models](/oss/integrations/text_embedding) if you wish.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core @upstash/vector @langchain/openai
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core @upstash/vector @langchain/openai
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core @upstash/vector @langchain/openai
```
</CodeGroup>

You can create an index from the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/login). For further reference, see [the official docs](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/getstarted).

Upstash vector also has built in embedding support. Which means you can use it directly without the need for an additional embedding model. Check the [embedding models documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels) for more details.

<Note>
To use the built-in Upstash embeddings, you'll need to select an embedding model when creating the index.
</Note>


### Credentials

Once you've set up an index, set the following environment variables:

```typescript
process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL = "your-rest-url";
process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN = "your-rest-token";
```

If you are using OpenAI embeddings for this guide, you'll need to set your OpenAI key as well:

```typescript
process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```typescript
// process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
// process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Instantiation

Make sure your index has the same dimension count as your embeddings. The default for OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` is 1536.

```typescript
import { UpstashVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({
  model: "text-embedding-3-small",
});

const indexWithCredentials = new Index({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN,
});

const vectorStore = new UpstashVectorStore(embeddings, {
  index: indexWithCredentials,
  // You can use namespaces to partition your data in an index
  // namespace: "test-namespace",
});
```

## Usage with built-in embeddings

To use the built-in Upstash embeddings, you can pass a `FakeEmbeddings` instance to the `UpstashVectorStore` constructor. This will make the `UpstashVectorStore` use the built-in embeddings, which you selected when creating the index.

```typescript
import { UpstashVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/upstash";
import { FakeEmbeddings } from "@langchain/core/utils/testing";

import { Index } from "@upstash/vector";

const indexWithEmbeddings = new Index({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN,
});

const vectorStore = new UpstashVectorStore(new FakeEmbeddings(), {
  index: indexWithEmbeddings,
});
```

## Manage vector store

### Add items to vector store

```typescript
import type { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const document1: Document = {
  pageContent: "The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document2: Document = {
  pageContent: "Buildings are made out of brick",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document3: Document = {
  pageContent: "Mitochondria are made out of lipids",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
};

const document4: Document = {
  pageContent: "The 2024 Olympics are in Paris",
  metadata: { source: "https://example.com" }
}

const documents = [document1, document2, document3, document4];

await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { ids: ["1", "2", "3", "4"] });
```

```output
[ '1', '2', '3', '4' ]
```

**Note:** After adding documents, there may be a slight delay before they become queryable.

### Delete items from vector store

```typescript
await vectorStore.delete({ ids: ["4"] });
```

## Query vector store

Once your vector store has been created and the relevant documents have been added you will most likely wish to query it during the running of your chain or agent.

### Query directly

Performing a simple similarity search can be done as follows:

```typescript
const filter = "source = 'https://example.com'";

const similaritySearchResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("biology", 2, filter);

for (const doc of similaritySearchResults) {
  console.log(`* ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata, null)}]`);
}
```

```output
* The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

See [this page](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/filtering) for more on Upstash Vector filter syntax.

If you want to execute a similarity search and receive the corresponding scores you can run:

```typescript
const similaritySearchWithScoreResults = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore("biology", 2, filter)

for (const [doc, score] of similaritySearchWithScoreResults) {
  console.log(`* [SIM=${score.toFixed(3)}] ${doc.pageContent} [${JSON.stringify(doc.metadata)}]`);
}
```

```output
* [SIM=0.576] The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
* [SIM=0.557] Mitochondria are made out of lipids [{"source":"https://example.com"}]
```

### Query by turning into retriever

You can also transform the vector store into a [retriever](/oss/langchain/retrieval) for easier usage in your chains.

```typescript
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
  // Optional filter
  filter: filter,
  k: 2,
});
await retriever.invoke("biology");
```

```output
[
  Document {
    pageContent: 'The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  },
  Document {
    pageContent: 'Mitochondria are made out of lipids',
    metadata: { source: 'https://example.com' },
    id: undefined
  }
]
```
