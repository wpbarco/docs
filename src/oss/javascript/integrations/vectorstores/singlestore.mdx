With built-in vector functions like [dot_product](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/dot_product.html) and [euclidean_distance](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/euclidean_distance.html), SingleStoreDB empowers developers to implement sophisticated algorithms efficiently.

For developers keen on leveraging vector data within SingleStoreDB, a comprehensive tutorial is available, guiding them through the intricacies of [working with vector data](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/developer-resources/functional-extensions/working-with-vector-data.html). This tutorial delves into the Vector Store within SingleStoreDB, showcasing its ability to facilitate searches based on vector similarity. Leveraging vector indexes, queries can be executed with remarkable speed, enabling swift retrieval of relevant data.

Moreover, SingleStoreDB's Vector Store seamlessly integrates with [full-text indexing based on Lucene](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/developer-resources/functional-extensions/working-with-full-text-search/), enabling powerful text similarity searches. Users can filter search results based on selected fields of document metadata objects, enhancing query precision.

What sets SingleStoreDB apart is its ability to combine vector and full-text searches in various ways, offering flexibility and versatility. Whether prefiltering by text or vector similarity and selecting the most relevant data, or employing a weighted sum approach to compute a final similarity score, developers have multiple options at their disposal.

In essence, SingleStoreDB provides a comprehensive solution for managing and querying vector data, offering unparalleled performance and flexibility for AI-driven applications.

<Tip>
**Compatibility**

Only available on Node.js.
</Tip>

LangChain.js requires the `mysql2` library to create a connection to a SingleStoreDB instance.

## Setup

1. Establish a SingleStoreDB environment. You have the flexibility to choose between [Cloud-based](https://docs.singlestore.com/managed-service/en/getting-started-with-singlestoredb-cloud.html) or [On-Premise](https://docs.singlestore.com/db/v8.1/en/developer-resources/get-started-using-singlestoredb-for-free.html) editions.
2. Install the mysql2 JS client

```bash npm
npm install -S mysql2
```
## Usage

`SingleStoreVectorStore` manages a connection pool. It is recommended to call `await store.end();` before terminating your application to assure all connections are appropriately closed and prevent any possible resource leaks.

### Standard usage

<Tip>
See [this section for general instructions on installing LangChain packages](/oss/langchain/install).
</Tip>

```bash npm
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

```typescript
import { SingleStoreVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/singlestore";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

export const run = async () => {
  const vectorStore = await SingleStoreVectorStore.fromTexts(
    ["Hello world", "Bye bye", "hello nice world"],
    [{ id: 2 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 3 }],
    new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    {
      connectionOptions: {
        host: process.env.SINGLESTORE_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.SINGLESTORE_PORT),
        user: process.env.SINGLESTORE_USERNAME,
        password: process.env.SINGLESTORE_PASSWORD,
        database: process.env.SINGLESTORE_DATABASE,
      },
    }
  );

  const resultOne = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("hello world", 1);
  console.log(resultOne);
  await vectorStore.end();
};
```

### Metadata Filtering

```typescript
import { SingleStoreVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/singlestore";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

export const run = async () => {
  const vectorStore = await SingleStoreVectorStore.fromTexts(
    ["Good afternoon", "Bye bye", "Boa tarde!", "AtÃ© logo!"],
    [
      { id: 1, language: "English" },
      { id: 2, language: "English" },
      { id: 3, language: "Portugese" },
      { id: 4, language: "Portugese" },
    ],
    new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    {
      connectionOptions: {
        host: process.env.SINGLESTORE_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.SINGLESTORE_PORT),
        user: process.env.SINGLESTORE_USERNAME,
        password: process.env.SINGLESTORE_PASSWORD,
        database: process.env.SINGLESTORE_DATABASE,
      },
      distanceMetric: "EUCLIDEAN_DISTANCE",
    }
  );

  const resultOne = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("greetings", 1, {
    language: "Portugese",
  });
  console.log(resultOne);
  await vectorStore.end();
};
```

### Vector indexes

Enhance your search efficiency with SingleStore DB version 8.5 or above by leveraging [ANN vector indexes](https://docs.singlestore.com/cloud/reference/sql-reference/vector-functions/vector-indexing/).
By setting `useVectorIndex: true` during vector store object creation, you can activate this feature.
Additionally, if your vectors differ in dimensionality from the default OpenAI embedding size of 1536, ensure to specify the `vectorSize` parameter accordingly.

### Hybrid search

```typescript
import { SingleStoreVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/singlestore";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

export const run = async () => {
  const vectorStore = await SingleStoreVectorStore.fromTexts(
    [
      "In the parched desert, a sudden rainstorm brought relief, as the droplets danced upon the thirsty earth, rejuvenating the landscape with the sweet scent of petrichor.",
      "Amidst the bustling cityscape, the rain fell relentlessly, creating a symphony of pitter-patter on the pavement, while umbrellas bloomed like colorful flowers in a sea of gray.",
      "High in the mountains, the rain transformed into a delicate mist, enveloping the peaks in a mystical veil, where each droplet seemed to whisper secrets to the ancient rocks below.",
      "Blanketing the countryside in a soft, pristine layer, the snowfall painted a serene tableau, muffling the world in a tranquil hush as delicate flakes settled upon the branches of trees like nature's own lacework.",
      "In the urban landscape, snow descended, transforming bustling streets into a winter wonderland, where the laughter of children echoed amidst the flurry of snowballs and the twinkle of holiday lights.",
      "Atop the rugged peaks, snow fell with an unyielding intensity, sculpting the landscape into a pristine alpine paradise, where the frozen crystals shimmered under the moonlight, casting a spell of enchantment over the wilderness below.",
    ],
    [
      { category: "rain" },
      { category: "rain" },
      { category: "rain" },
      { category: "snow" },
      { category: "snow" },
      { category: "snow" },
    ],
    new OpenAIEmbeddings(),
    {
      connectionOptions: {
        host: process.env.SINGLESTORE_HOST,
        port: Number(process.env.SINGLESTORE_PORT),
        user: process.env.SINGLESTORE_USERNAME,
        password: process.env.SINGLESTORE_PASSWORD,
        database: process.env.SINGLESTORE_DATABASE,
      },
      distanceMetric: "DOT_PRODUCT",
      useVectorIndex: true,
      useFullTextIndex: true,
    }
  );

  const resultOne = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    1,
    { category: "rain" }
  );
  console.log(resultOne[0].pageContent);

  await vectorStore.setSearchConfig({
    searchStrategy: "TEXT_ONLY",
  });
  const resultTwo = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    1
  );
  console.log(resultTwo[0].pageContent);

  await vectorStore.setSearchConfig({
    searchStrategy: "FILTER_BY_TEXT",
    filterThreshold: 0.1,
  });
  const resultThree = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    1
  );
  console.log(resultThree[0].pageContent);

  await vectorStore.setSearchConfig({
    searchStrategy: "FILTER_BY_VECTOR",
    filterThreshold: 0.1,
  });
  const resultFour = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    1
  );
  console.log(resultFour[0].pageContent);

  await vectorStore.setSearchConfig({
    searchStrategy: "WEIGHTED_SUM",
    textWeight: 0.2,
    vectorWeight: 0.8,
    vectorselectCountMultiplier: 10,
  });
  const resultFive = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
    "rainstorm in parched desert, rain",
    1
  );
  console.log(resultFive[0].pageContent);

  await vectorStore.end();
};
```
