This example goes over how to load data from a Figma file.
You will need a Figma access token in order to get started.

```typescript
import { FigmaFileLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/figma";

const loader = new FigmaFileLoader({
  accessToken: "FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN", // or load it from process.env.FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN
  nodeIds: ["id1", "id2", "id3"],
  fileKey: "key",
});
const docs = await loader.load();

console.log({ docs });
```

You can find your Figma file's key and node ids by opening the file in your browser and extracting them from the URL:

```
https://www.figma.com/file/<YOUR FILE KEY HERE>/LangChainJS-Test?type=whiteboard&node-id=<YOUR NODE ID HERE>&t=e6lqWkKecuYQRyRg-0
```
