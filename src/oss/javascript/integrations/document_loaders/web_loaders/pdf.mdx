This notebook provides a quick overview for getting started with [WebPDFLoader](/oss/integrations/document_loaders/). For detailed documentation of all WebPDFLoader features and configurations head to the [API reference](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_document_loaders_web_pdf.WebPDFLoader.html).

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | PY support |

| [WebPDFLoader](https://api.js.langchain.com/classes/langchain_community_document_loaders_web_pdf.WebPDFLoader.html) | [@langchain/community](https://api.js.langchain.com/modules/langchain_community_document_loaders_web_pdf.html) | ✅ | beta | ❌ |

### Loader features

| Source | Web Loader | Node Envs Only
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| WebPDFLoader | ✅ | ❌ |

You can use this version of the popular PDFLoader in web environments.
By default, one document will be created for each page in the PDF file, you can change this behavior by setting the `splitPages` option to `false`.

## Setup

To access `WebPDFLoader` document loader you'll need to install the `@langchain/community` integration, along with the `pdf-parse` package:

### Credentials

If you want to get automated tracing of your model calls you can also set your [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key by uncommenting below:

```bash
# export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
# export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### Installation

The LangChain WebPDFLoader integration lives in the `@langchain/community` package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash yarn
yarn add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add @langchain/community @langchain/core pdf-parse
```
</CodeGroup>

## Instantiation

Now we can instantiate our model object and load documents:

```typescript
import fs from "fs/promises";
import { WebPDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/pdf"

const nike10kPDFPath = "../../../../data/nke-10k-2023.pdf";

// Read the file as a buffer
const buffer = await fs.readFile(nike10kPDFPath);

// Create a Blob from the buffer
const nike10kPDFBlob = new Blob([buffer], { type: 'application/pdf' });

const loader = new WebPDFLoader(nike10kPDFBlob, {
  // required params = ...
  // optional params = ...
})
```

## Load

```typescript
const docs = await loader.load()
docs[0]
```

## Usage, custom `pdfjs` build

By default we use the `pdfjs` build bundled with `pdf-parse`, which is compatible with most environments, including Node.js and modern browsers. If you want to use a more recent version of `pdfjs-dist` or if you want to use a custom build of `pdfjs-dist`, you can do so by providing a custom `pdfjs` function that returns a promise that resolves to the `PDFJS` object.

In the following example we use the "legacy" (see [pdfjs docs](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#which-browsersenvironments-are-supported)) build of `pdfjs-dist`, which includes several polyfills not included in the default build.

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install pdfjs-dist
```
```bash yarn
yarn add pdfjs-dist
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add pdfjs-dist
```
</CodeGroup>


```typescript
import { WebPDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/pdf";

const blob = new Blob(); // e.g. from a file input

const customBuildLoader = new WebPDFLoader(blob, {
  // you may need to add `.then(m => m.default)` to the end of the import
  // @lc-ts-ignore
  pdfjs: () => import("pdfjs-dist/legacy/build/pdf.js"),
});
```

## Eliminating extra spaces

PDFs come in many varieties, which makes reading them a challenge. The loader parses individual text elements and joins them together with a space by default, but
if you are seeing excessive spaces, this may not be the desired behavior. In that case, you can override the separator with an empty string like this:

```typescript
import { WebPDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/web/pdf";

// new Blob(); e.g. from a file input
const eliminatingExtraSpacesLoader = new WebPDFLoader(new Blob(), {
  parsedItemSeparator: "",
});
```
