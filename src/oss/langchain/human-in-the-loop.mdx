title: Human-in-the-loop
---



The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) middleware lets you add human oversight to agent tool calls.
When a model proposes an action that might require review ‚Äî for example, writing to a file or executing SQL ‚Äî the middleware can pause execution and wait for a decision.

It does this by checking each tool call against a configurable policy. If intervention is needed, the middleware issues an @[interrupt] that halts execution. The graph state is saved using LangGraph‚Äôs [persistence layer](/oss/langgraph/persistence), so execution can pause safely and resume later.

A human decision then determines what happens next: the action can be approved as-is (`approve`), modified before running (`edit`), or rejected with feedback (`reject`).

## Interrupt decision types

The middleware defines three built-in ways a human can respond to an interrupt:

| Decision Type | Description                                                               | Example Use Case                                    |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ `approve`   | The action is approved as-is and executed without changes.                | Send an email draft exactly as written              |
| ‚úèÔ∏è `edit`     | The tool call is executed with modifications.                             | Change the recipient before sending an email        |
| ‚ùå `reject`    | The tool call is rejected, with an explanation added to the conversation. | Reject an email draft and explain how to rewrite it |

The available decision types for each tool depend on the policy you configure in `interrupt_on`.
When multiple tool calls are paused at the same time, each action requires a separate decision.
Decisions must be provided in the same order as the actions appear in the interrupt request.

<Tip>
When **editing** tool arguments, make changes conservatively. Significant modifications to the original arguments may cause the model to re-evaluate its approach and potentially execute the tool multiple times or take unexpected actions.
</Tip>


## Configuring interrupts

To use HITL, add the middleware to the agent‚Äôs `middleware` list when creating the agent.

You configure it with a mapping of tool actions to the decision types that are allowed for each action. The middleware will interrupt execution when a tool call matches an action in the mapping.

:::python
```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware # [!code highlight]
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver # [!code highlight]


agent = create_agent(
    model="openai:gpt-4o",

    checkpointer: new MemorySaver(), // [!code highlight]

```
:::


<Info>
    You must configure a checkpointer to persist the graph state across interrupts.
    In production, use a persistent checkpointer like @[`AsyncPostgresSaver`]. For testing or prototyping, use @[`InMemorySaver`].

    When invoking the agent, pass a `config` that includes the **thread ID** to associate execution with a conversation thread.
    See the [LangGraph interrupts documentation](/oss/langgraph/interrupts) for details.
</Info>


## Responding to interrupts

When you invoke the agent, it runs until it either completes or an interrupt is raised. An interrupt is triggered when a tool call matches the policy you configured in `interrupt_on`. In that case, the invocation result will include an `__interrupt__` field with the actions that require review. You can then present those actions to a reviewer and resume execution once decisions are provided.


:::python
```python
from langgraph.types import Command

# Human-in-the-loop leverages LangGraph's persistence layer.
# You must provide a thread ID to associate the execution with a conversation thread,
# so the conversation can be paused and resumed (as is needed for human review).
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}} # [!code highlight]
# Run the graph until the interrupt is hit.
result = agent.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Delete old records from the database",
            }
        ]
    },
    config=config # [!code highlight]

# The interrupt contains the full HITL request with action_requests and review_configs
print(result['__interrupt__'])

    <Tip>
        When **editing** tool arguments, make changes conservatively. Significant modifications to the original arguments may cause the model to re-evaluate its approach and potentially execute the tool multiple times or take unexpected actions.

The `message` is added to the conversation as feedback to help the agent understand why the action was rejected and what it should do instead.

### Multiple decisions

When multiple actions are under review, provide a decision for each action in the same order as they appear in the interrupt:

:::python
```python
{
    "decisions": [
        {"type": "approve"},
        {
            "type": "edit",
            "edited_action": {
                "name": "tool_name",
                "args": {"param": "new_value"}
            }
        },
        {
            "type": "reject",
            "message": "This action is not allowed"
        }
    ]
}
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
{
    decisions: [
        { type: "approve" },
        {
            type: "edit",
            editedAction: {
                name: "tool_name",
                args: { param: "new_value" }
            }
        },
        {
            type: "reject",
            message: "This action is not allowed"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Execution lifecycle

The middleware defines an `after_model` hook that runs after the model generates a response but before any tool calls are executed:

1. The agent invokes the model to generate a response.
2. The middleware inspects the response for tool calls.
3. If any calls require human input, the middleware builds a `HITLRequest` with `action_requests` and `review_configs` and calls @[interrupt].
4. The agent waits for human decisions.
5. Based on the `HITLResponse` decisions, the middleware executes approved or edited calls, synthesizes @[ToolMessage]'s for rejected calls, and resumes execution.



## Custom HITL logic

For more specialized workflows, you can build custom HITL logic directly using the @[interrupt] primitive and [middleware](/oss/langchain/middleware) abstraction.

Review the [execution lifecycle](#execution-lifecycle) above to understand how to integrate interrupts into the agent's operation.
