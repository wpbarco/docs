title: MODEL_RATE_LIMIT
---

You have hit the maximum number of requests that a model provider allows over a given time period and are being temporarily blocked.

This error occurs when you exceed the maximum number of requests permitted by your model provider within a specific timeframe, resulting in temporary blocking. The restriction is generally temporary and lifts after the limit resets.

## Troubleshooting

To resolve this error, you can:

1. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Deploy a rate limiter to regulate the frequency of requests sent to the model. See [rate limiting](/oss/langchain/models#rate-limiting) docs.
2. **Implement Response Caching**: Use model response caching to reduce redundant requests when incoming queries are repetitive.
3. **Use Multiple Providers**: Distribute requests across multiple providers if your application architecture supports this approach
4. **Contact Your Provider**: Reach out to your model provider requesting an increase to your rate limits
