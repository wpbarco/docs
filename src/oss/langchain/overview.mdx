LangChain is the easiest way to start building agents and applications powered by LLMs. With under 10 lines of code, you can connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and [more](/oss/integrations/providers/overview). LangChain provides a pre-built agent architecture and model integrations to help you get started quickly and seamlessly incorporate LLMs into your agents and applications.

We recommend you use LangChain if you want to quickly build agents and autonomous applications. Use [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview), our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows, heavy customization, and carefully controlled latency.

LangChain [agents](/oss/langchain/agents) are built on top of LangGraph in order to provide durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, persistence, and more. You do not need to know LangGraph for basic LangChain agent usage.

    <Card title="Standard model interface" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/oss/langchain/models" arrow cta="Learn more">
        Different providers have unique APIs for interacting with models, including the format of responses. LangChain standardizes how you interact with models so that you can seamlessly swap providers and avoid lock-in.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Easy to use, highly flexible agent" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" href="/oss/langchain/agents" arrow cta="Learn more">
        LangChain's agent abstraction is designed to be easy to get started with, letting you build a simple agent in under 10 lines of code. But it also provides enough flexibility to allow you to do all the context engineering your heart desires.
    </Card>

    <Card title="Built on top of LangGraph" icon="circle-nodes" href="/oss/langgraph/overview" arrow cta="Learn more">
        LangChain's agents are built on top of LangGraph. This allows us to take advantage of LangGraph's durable execution, human-in-the-loop support, persistence, and more.
