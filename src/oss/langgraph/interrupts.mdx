title: Interrupts
---



Interrupts allow you to pause graph execution at specific points and wait for external input before continuing. This enables human-in-the-loop patterns where you need external input to proceed. When an interrupt is triggered, LangGraph saves the graph state using its [persistence](/oss/langgraph/persistence) layer and waits indefinitely until you resume execution.

Interrupts work by calling the `interrupt()` function at any point in your graph nodes. The function accepts any JSON-serializable value which is surfaced to the caller. When you're ready to continue, you resume execution by re-invoking the graph using `Command`, which then becomes the return value of the `interrupt()` call from inside the node.

Unlike static breakpoints (which pause before or after specific nodes), interrupts are **dynamic**—they can be placed anywhere in your code and can be conditional based on your application logic.

:::python
- **Checkpointing keeps your place:** the checkpointer writes the exact graph state so you can resume later, even when in an error state.
- **`thread_id` is your pointer:** set `config={"configurable": {"thread_id": ...}}` to tell the checkpointer which state to load.
- **Interrupt payloads surface as `__interrupt__`:** the values you pass to `interrupt()` return to the caller in the `__interrupt__` field so you know what the graph is waiting on.
:::
:::js
- **Checkpointing keeps your place:** the checkpointer writes the exact graph state so you can resume later, even when in an error state.
- **`thread_id` is your pointer:** use `{ configurable: { thread_id: ... } }` as options to the `invoke` method to tell the checkpointer which state to load.
- **Interrupt payloads surface as `__interrupt__`:** the values you pass to `interrupt()` return to the caller in the `__interrupt__` field so you know what the graph is waiting on.
:::

The `thread_id` you choose is effectively your persistent cursor. Reusing it resumes the same checkpoint; using a new value starts a brand-new thread with an empty state.

## Pause using `interrupt`

The @[`interrupt`] function pauses graph execution and returns a value to the caller. When you call @[`interrupt`] within a node, LangGraph saves the current graph state and waits for you to resume execution with input.

To use @[`interrupt`], you need:
1. A **checkpointer** to persist the graph state (use a durable checkpointer in production)
2. A **thread ID** in your config so the runtime knows which state to resume from
3. To call `interrupt()` where you want to pause (payload must be JSON-serializable)

:::python
```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def approval_node(state: State):
    # Pause and ask for approval
    approved = interrupt("Do you approve this action?")

    # When you resume, Command(resume=...) returns that value here
    return {"approved": approved}
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

async function approvalNode(state: State) {
    // Pause and ask for approval
    const approved = interrupt("Do you approve this action?");

    // Command({ resume: ... }) provides the value returned into this variable
    return { approved };
}
```
:::

When you call @[`interrupt`], here's what happens:

1. **Graph execution gets suspended** at the exact point where @[`interrupt`] is called
2. **State is saved** using the checkpointer so execution can be resumed later, In production, this should be a persistent checkpointer (e.g. backed by a database)
3. **Value is returned** to the caller under `__interrupt__`; it can be any JSON-serializable value (string, object, array, etc.)
4. **Graph waits indefinitely** until you resume execution with a response
5. **Response is passed back** into the node when you resume, becoming the return value of the `interrupt()` call

## Resuming interrupts

After an interrupt pauses execution, you resume the graph by invoking it again with a `Command` that contains the resume value. The resume value is passed back to the `interrupt` call, allowing the node to continue execution with the external input.

:::python
```python
from langgraph.types import Command

# Initial run - hits the interrupt and pauses
# thread_id is the persistent pointer (stores a stable ID in production)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "thread-1"}}
result = graph.invoke({"input": "data"}, config=config)

# Check what was interrupted
# __interrupt__ contains the payload that was passed to interrupt()
print(result["__interrupt__"])
# > [Interrupt(value='Do you approve this action?')]

# Resume with the human's response
# The resume payload becomes the return value of interrupt() inside the node
graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

// Initial run - hits the interrupt and pauses
// thread_id is the durable pointer back to the saved checkpoint
const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "thread-1" } };
const result = await graph.invoke({ input: "data" }, config);

// Check what was interrupted
// __interrupt__ mirrors every payload you passed to interrupt()
console.log(result.__interrupt__);
// [{ value: 'Do you approve this action?', ... }]

// Resume with the human's response
// Command({ resume }) returns that value from interrupt() in the node
await graph.invoke(new Command({ resume: true }), config);
```
:::

**Key points about resuming:**

- You must use the **same thread ID** when resuming that was used when the interrupt occurred
- The value passed to `Command(resume=...)` becomes the return value of the @[`interrupt`] call
- The node restarts from the beginning of the node where the @[`interrupt`] was called when resumed, so any code before the @[`interrupt`] runs again
- You can pass any JSON-serializable value as the resume value

## Common patterns

The key thing that interrupts unlock is the ability to pause execution and wait for external input. This is useful for a variety of use cases, including:

- <Icon icon="check-circle" /> [Approval workflows](#approve-or-reject): Pause before executing critical actions (API calls, database changes, financial transactions)
- <Icon icon="pencil" /> [Review and edit](#review-and-edit-state): Let humans review and modify LLM outputs or tool calls before continuing
- <Icon icon="wrench" /> [Interrupting tool calls](#interrupts-in-tools): Pause before executing tool calls to review and edit the tool call before execution
- <Icon icon="shield-check" /> [Validating human input](#validating-human-input): Pause before proceeding to the next step to validate human input

### Approve or reject

One of the most common uses of interrupts is to pause before a critical action and ask for approval. For example, you might want to ask a human to approve an API call, a database change, or any other important decision.

:::python
```python
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command

def approval_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["proceed", "cancel"]]:
    # Pause execution; payload shows up under result["__interrupt__"]
    is_approved = interrupt({
        "question": "Do you want to proceed with this action?",
        "details": state["action_details"]
    })

    # Route based on the response
    if is_approved:
        return Command(goto="proceed")  # Runs after the resume payload is provided
    else:
        return Command(goto="cancel")
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { interrupt, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

function approvalNode(state: State): Command {
  // Pause execution; payload surfaces in result.__interrupt__
  const isApproved = interrupt({
    question: "Do you want to proceed?",
    details: state.actionDetails
  });

  // Route based on the response
  if (isApproved) {
    return new Command({ goto: "proceed" }); // Runs after the resume payload is provided
  } else {
    return new Command({ goto: "cancel" });
  }
}
```
:::

When you resume the graph, pass `true` to approve or `false` to reject:

:::python
```python
# To approve
graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=config)

# To reject
graph.invoke(Command(resume=False), config=config)
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
// To approve
await graph.invoke(new Command({ resume: true }), config);

// To reject
await graph.invoke(new Command({ resume: false }), config);
```

### Review and edit state

Sometimes you want to let a human review and edit part of the graph state before continuing. This is useful for correcting LLMs, adding missing information, or making adjustments.

:::python
```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def review_node(state: State):
    # Pause and show the current content for review (surfaces in result["__interrupt__"])
    edited_content = interrupt({
        "instruction": "Review and edit this content",
        "content": state["generated_text"]
    })

    # Update the state with the edited version
    return {"generated_text": edited_content}
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";

function reviewNode(state: State) {
  // Pause and show the current content for review (surfaces in result.__interrupt__)
  const editedContent = interrupt({
    instruction: "Review and edit this content",
    content: state.generatedText
  });

  // Update the state with the edited version
  return { generatedText: editedContent };
}
```
:::

When resuming, provide the edited content:

:::python
```python
graph.invoke(
    Command(resume="The edited and improved text"),  # Value becomes the return from interrupt()
    config=config
)
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
await graph.invoke(
  new Command({ resume: "The edited and improved text" }), // Value becomes the return from interrupt()
  config
);

    def review_node(state: ReviewState):
        # Ask a reviewer to edit the generated content

### Interrupts in tools

You can also place interrupts directly inside tool functions. This makes the tool itself pause for approval whenever it's called, and allows for human review and editing of the tool call before it is executed.

First, define a tool that uses @[`interrupt`]:

:::python
```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from langgraph.types import interrupt

@tool
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    """Send an email to a recipient."""

    # Pause before sending; payload surfaces in result["__interrupt__"]
    response = interrupt({
        "action": "send_email",
        "to": to,
        "subject": subject,
        "body": body,
        "message": "Approve sending this email?"
    })

    if response.get("action") == "approve":
        # Resume value can override inputs before executing
        final_to = response.get("to", to)
        final_subject = response.get("subject", subject)
        final_body = response.get("body", body)
        return f"Email sent to {final_to} with subject '{final_subject}'"
    return "Email cancelled by user"
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { interrupt } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const sendEmailTool = tool(
  async ({ to, subject, body }) => {
    // Pause before sending; payload surfaces in result.__interrupt__
    const response = interrupt({
      action: "send_email",
      to,
      subject,
      body,
      message: "Approve sending this email?",
    });

    if (response?.action === "approve") {
      // Resume value can override inputs before executing
      const finalTo = response.to ?? to;
      const finalSubject = response.subject ?? subject;
      const finalBody = response.body ?? body;
      return `Email sent to ${finalTo} with subject '${finalSubject}'`;
    }
    return "Email cancelled by user";
  },
  {
    name: "send_email",
    description: "Send an email to a recipient",
    schema: z.object({
      to: z.string(),
      subject: z.string(),
      body: z.string(),
    }),
  },
);
```
:::

This approach is useful when you want the approval logic to live with the tool itself, making it reusable across different parts of your graph. The LLM can call the tool naturally, and the interrupt will pause execution whenever the tool is invoked, allowing you to approve, edit, or cancel the action.

### Validating human input

Sometimes you need to validate input from humans and ask again if it's invalid. You can do this using multiple @[`interrupt`] calls in a loop.

:::python
```python
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def get_age_node(state: State):
    prompt = "What is your age?"

    while True:
        answer = interrupt(prompt)  # payload surfaces in result["__interrupt__"]

        # Validate the input
        if isinstance(answer, int) and answer > 0:
            # Valid input - continue

## Rules of interrupts

When you call @[`interrupt`] within a node, LangGraph suspends execution by raising an exception that signals the runtime to pause. This exception propagates up through the call stack and is caught by the runtime, which notifies the graph to save the current state and wait for external input.

When execution resumes (after you provide the requested input), the runtime restarts the entire node from the beginning—it does not resume from the exact line where @[`interrupt`] was called. This means any code that ran before the @[`interrupt`] will execute again. Because of this, there's a few important rules to follow when working with interrupts to ensure they behave as expected.

:::python
### Do not wrap `interrupt` calls in try/except

The way that @[`interrupt`] pauses execution at the point of the call is by throwing a special exception. If you wrap the @[`interrupt`] call in a try/except block, you will catch this exception and the interrupt will not be passed back to the graph.

* ✅ Separate @[`interrupt`] calls from error-prone code
* ✅ Use specific exception types in try/except blocks

<CodeGroup>
```python Separating logic
def node_a(state: State):
    # ✅ Good: interrupting first, then handling
    # error conditions separately
    interrupt("What's your name?")
    try:
        fetch_data()  # This can fail
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    return state
```
```python Explicit exception handling
def node_a(state: State):
    # ✅ Good: catching specific exception types
    # will not catch the interrupt exception
    try:
        name = interrupt("What's your name?")
        fetch_data()  # This can fail
    except NetworkException as e:
        print(e)
    return state
```
</CodeGroup>

* 🔴 Do not wrap @[`interrupt`] calls in bare try/except blocks

```python
def node_a(state: State):
    # ❌ Bad: wrapping interrupt in bare try/except
    # will catch the interrupt exception
    try:
        interrupt("What's your name?")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
    return state
```
:::

:::js
### Do not wrap `interrupt` calls in try/catch

The way that @[`interrupt`] pauses execution at the point of the call is by throwing a special exception. If you wrap the @[`interrupt`] call in a try/catch block, you will catch this exception and the interrupt will not be passed back to the graph.

* ✅ Separate @[`interrupt`] calls from error-prone code
* ✅ Conditionally catch errors if needed

```typescript Separating logic
async function nodeA(state: State) {
    // ✅ Good: interrupting first, then handling error conditions separately
    const name = interrupt("What's your name?");

        await fetchData(); // This can fail
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(error);
    }
    return state;
}
```
```typescript Conditionally handling errors
async function nodeA(state: State) {
    // ✅ Good: re-throwing the exception will
    // allow the interrupt to be passed back to
    // the graph
    try {
        const name = interrupt("What's your name?");
        await fetchData(); // This can fail
    } catch (err) {
        if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
            console.error(error);
        }
        throw error;
    }
    return state;
}
```

* 🔴 Do not wrap @[`interrupt`] calls in bare try/catch blocks

```typescript

    // ❌ Bad: wrapping interrupt in bare try/catch will catch the interrupt exception
    try {
        const name = interrupt("What's your name?");
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(error);
    }
    return state;
}
```
:::

### Do not reorder `interrupt` calls within a node

It's common to use multiple interrupts in a single node, however this can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.

When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is **strictly index-based**, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is important.

* ✅ Keep @[`interrupt`] calls consistent across node executions

:::python
```python
def node_a(state: State):
    # ✅ Good: interrupt calls happen in the same order every time
    name = interrupt("What's your name?")
    age = interrupt("What's your age?")
    city = interrupt("What's your city?")

    return {
        "name": name,
        "age": age,
        "city": city
    }
```
:::
:::js
```typescript
async function nodeA(state: State) {
    // ✅ Good: interrupt calls happen in the same order every time
    const name = interrupt("What's your name?");
    const age = interrupt("What's your age?");
    const city = interrupt("What's your city?");

    return {
        name,
        age,
        city
    };
}

### Do not return complex values in `interrupt` calls

Depending on which checkpointer is used, complex values may not be serializable (e.g. you can't serialize a function). To make your graphs adaptable to any deployment, it's best practice to only use values that can be reasonably serialized.

* ✅ Pass simple, JSON-serializable types to @[`interrupt`]
* ✅ Pass dictionaries/objects with simple values

    response = interrupt({
        "question": "Enter user details",
        "fields": ["name", "email", "age"],
        "current_values": state.get("user", {})

### Side effects called before `interrupt` must be idempotent

Because interrupts work by re-running the nodes they were called from, side effects called before @[`interrupt`] should (ideally) be idempotent. For context, idempotency means that the same operation can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial execution.

As an example, you might have an API call to update a record inside of a node. If @[`interrupt`] is called after that call is made, it will be re-run multiple times when the node is resumed, potentially overwriting the initial update or creating duplicate records.

* ✅ Use idempotent operations before @[`interrupt`]
* ✅ Place side effects after @[`interrupt`] calls
* ✅ Separate side effects into separate nodes when possible

:::python

```python Idempotent operations

        status="pending_approval"
    )

    approved = interrupt("Approve this change?")

    return {"approved": approved}

```python Side effects after interrupt
def node_a(state: State):
    # ✅ Good: placing side effect after the interrupt
    # This ensures it only runs once after approval is received
    approved = interrupt("Approve this change?")

    if approved:

## Using with subgraphs called as functions

When invoking a subgraph within a node, the parent graph will resume execution from the **beginning of the node** where the subgraph was invoked and the @[`interrupt`] was triggered. Similarly, the **subgraph** will also resume from the beginning of the node where @[`interrupt`] was called.

:::python
```python
def node_in_parent_graph(state: State):
    some_code()  # <-- This will re-execute when resumed
    # Invoke a subgraph as a function.
    # The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call.
    subgraph_result = subgraph.invoke(some_input)

async function node_in_subgraph(state: State) {
    someOtherCode(); # <-- This will also re-execute when resumed
    result = interrupt("What's your name?")
    ...
}
```
:::
:::js
```typescript
async function nodeInParentGraph(state: State) {
    someCode(); // <-- This will re-execute when resumed
    // Invoke a subgraph as a function.
    // The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call.
    const subgraphResult = await subgraph.invoke(someInput);
    // ...
}

## Debugging with interrupts

:::python
To debug and test a graph, you can use static interrupts as breakpoints to step through the graph execution one node at a time. Static interrupts are triggered at defined points either before or after a node executes. You can set these by specifying `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after` when compiling the graph.

        5. The graph is run until the first breakpoint is hit.
        6. The graph is resumed by passing in `null` for the input. This will run the graph until the next breakpoint is hit.

### Using LangGraph Studio

You can use [LangGraph Studio](/langsmith/studio) to set static interrupts in your graph in the UI before running the graph. You can also use the UI to inspect the graph state at any point in the execution.
