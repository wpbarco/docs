title: Deep Agents
description: Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks
---

## Overview

Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. This architecture has been popular ever since we started building agents. However, simple tool-calling loops can be too "shallow" and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks. Applications like "Deep Research", "Manus", and "Claude Code" have gotten around this limitation by implementing a combination of four things:

1. a planning tool to break down complex tasks into discrete steps
2. the ability to spawn sub-agents to work on isolated parts of a task
3. access to a file system for offloading large context, and storing long-term memories
4. a detailed system prompt with plenty of examples on when to use each tool

**Deep Agents** come equipped with these capabilities out of the box! With deep agents, you can quickly tackle complex, context-heavy problems that a naive tool-calling loop wouldn't be able to handle.

## Quickstart

Deep Agents are available as a standalone library.

```bash
pip install deepagents
```

You can create a Deep Agent with the `create_deep_agent` builder.

(To run the example below, you'll need to `pip install tavily-python`)

```python
import os
from typing import Literal
from tavily import TavilyClient
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

tavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key=os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"])

# Search tool to use to do research
def internet_search(
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 5,
    topic: Literal["general", "news", "finance"] = "general",
    include_raw_content: bool = False,
):
    """Run a web search"""
    search_docs = tavily_client.search(
        query,
        max_results=max_results,
        include_raw_content=include_raw_content,
        topic=topic,
    )
    return search_docs

# System prompt to steer the agent to be an expert researcher
research_instructions = """You are an expert researcher. Your job is to conduct thorough research, and then write a polished report.

You have access to an internet search tool.

## `internet_search`
Use this to run an internet search for a given query. You can specify the number of results, the topic, and whether raw content should be included.
"""

agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    tools=[internet_search],
    system_prompt=research_instructions
)

result = agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is langgraph?"}]})
```
