    <Accordion title="Report bugs" icon="bug">
        Found a bug? Please help us fix it by following these steps:

        <Steps>
            <Step title="Search">
                Check if the issue already exists in our GitHub Issues for the respective repo:

                :::python

                    <Card title="LangChain" icon="link" href="https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/issues">Issues</Card>

                :::
            </Step>
            <Step title="Create issue">
                If no issue exists, create a new one. When writing, be sure to follow the template provided and to include a [minimal, reproducible, example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Attach any relevant labels to the final issue once created. If a project maintainer is unable to reproduce the issue, it is unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.
            </Step>
            <Step title="Wait">
                A project maintainer will triage the issue and may ask for additional information. Please be patient as we manage a high volume of issues. Do not bump the issue unless you have new information to provide.
            </Step>
        </Steps>

        If you are adding an issue, please try to keep it focused on a single topic. If two issues are related, or blocking, please [link them](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) rather than combining them. For example,

        ```text
        This issue is blocked by #123 and related to #456.
        ```
