Code contributions are always welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving performance, your contributions help deliver a better developer experience for thousands of developers.

<Note>
    Before submitting large **new features or refactors**, please first discuss your ideas in [the forum](https://forum.langchain.com/). This ensures alignment with project goals and prevents duplicate work.

    This does not apply to bugfixes or small improvements, which you can contribute directly via pull requests. Be sure to link any relevant issues in your PR description. Use <Tooltip tip="(e.g. `Fixes #123`)">closing keywords</Tooltip> to automatically close issues when the PR is merged.

    New integrations should follow the [integration guidelines](/oss/contributing#add-a-new-integration).
</Note>

## Philosophy

Aim to follow these core principles for all code contributions:

        Fork the [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs) or [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs) repo to your personal GitHub account
        :::
    </Step>

    <Step title="Clone and setup">
        :::python

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-of-forked-repo.git

        # For instance, for LangChain:
        git clone https://github.com/parrot123/langchain.git

        # For LangGraph:
        git clone https://github.com/parrot123/langgraph.git
        ```

        ```bash
        # Inside your repo, install dependencies
        uv sync --all-groups
        ```

        You will need to install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if you haven't previously.

        Fix the bug while following our [code quality standards](#code-quality-standards)
    </Step>

    <Step title="Add tests">
        Include [unit tests](#test-writing-guidelines) that fail without your fix. This allows us to verify the bug is resolved and prevents regressions
    </Step>

    :::js
    <Step title="Run build">
        Run the build command to ensure the package still builds properly
        ```bash
        pnpm build
        # or build a specific workspace package
        pnpm --filter @langchain/core build
        ```

## Development workflow

### Testing requirements

<Info>
    Directories are relative to the package you're working in.
</Info>

Every code change must include comprehensive tests.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Unit tests">
        :::python
        **Location**: `tests/unit_tests/`
        :::
        :::js
        **Location**: `src/tests/FILENAME_BEING_TESTED.test.ts`
        :::

        **Requirements**:
        - No network calls allowed
        - Test all code paths including edge cases
        - Use mocks for external dependencies

        :::python
        ```bash
        make test
        # Or directly:
        uv run --group test pytest tests/unit_tests
        ```
        :::
        :::js
        ```bash
        # Run the entire test suite
        pnpm test
        # Or run a specific test file
        pnpm test src/tests/FILENAME_BEING_TESTED.test.ts
        # Or run a specific test function
        pnpm test -t "the test that should be run"
        ```
        :::
    </Step>

    <Step title="Integration tests">
        Integration tests require access to external services/ provider APIs (which can cost money) and therefore are not run by default.

        Not every code change will require an integration test, but keep in mind that we'll require/ run integration tests separately as apart of our review process.

        :::python
        **Location**: `tests/integration_tests/`
        :::
        :::js
        **Location**: `src/tests/FILENAME_BEING_TESTED.int.test.ts`
        :::

        **Requirements**:
        - Test real integrations with external services
        - Use environment variables for API keys
        - Skip gracefully if credentials unavailable

        :::python
        ```bash
        make integration_tests
        ```
        :::
        :::js
        ```bash
        pnpm test:int
        ```
        :::
    </Step>

    <Step title="Test quality checklist">
        - Tests fail when your code is broken
        - Edge cases and error conditions are tested
        - Proper use of fixtures and mocks
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Contribution guidelines

### Backwards compatibility

<Warning>
    Breaking changes to public APIs are not allowed except for critical security fixes.

    See our [versioning policy](/oss/versioning) for details on major version releases.
</Warning>

Maintain compatibility:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Stable interfaces">
        **Always preserve**:
        - Function signatures and parameter names
        - Class interfaces and method names
        - Return value structure and types
        - Import paths for public APIs
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Safe changes">
        **Acceptable modifications**:
        :::python
        - Adding new optional parameters
        :::
        :::js
        - Adding new optional parameters/type parameters
        :::
        - Adding new methods to classes
        - Improving performance without changing behavior
        - Adding new modules or functions
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Before making changes">
        - **Would this break existing user code?**
        - Check if your target is public
        :::python
        - If needed, is it exported in `__init__.py`?
        :::
        - Are there existing usage patterns in tests?
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Bugfixes

For bugfix contributions:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Reproduce the issue">
        Create a minimal test case that demonstrates the bug. Maintainers and other contributors should be able to run this test and see the failure without additional setup or modification
    </Step>

    <Step title="Write failing tests">
        Add unit tests that would fail without your fix
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implement the fix">
        Make the **minimal change necessary** to resolve the issue
    </Step>

    <Step title="Verify the fix">
        Ensure that tests pass and no regressions are introduced
    </Step>

    <Step title="Document the change">
        Update docstrings if behavior changes, add comments for complex logic
    </Step>
</Steps>

### New features

We aim to keep the bar high for new features. We generally don't accept new core abstractions, changes to infra, changes to dependencies, or new agents/chains from outside contributors without an existing issue that demonstrates an acute need for them.

In general, feature contribution requirements include:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Design discussion">
        Open an issue describing:
        - The problem you're solving
        - Proposed API design
        - Expected usage patterns
    </Step>

    <Step title="Implementation">
        - Follow existing code patterns
        - Include comprehensive tests and documentation
        - Consider security implications
    </Step>

    <Step title="Integration considerations">
        - How does this interact with existing features?
        - Are there performance implications?
        - Does this introduce new dependencies?

        We will reject features that are likely to lead to security vulnerabilities or reports.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Security guidelines

<Warning>
    Security is paramount. Never introduce vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns.
</Warning>

Security checklist:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Input validation">
        - Validate and sanitize all user inputs
        - Properly escape data in templates and queries
        :::python
        - Never use `eval()`, `exec()`, or `pickle` on user data, as this can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
        :::
        :::js
        - Never use `eval()`, as this can lead to arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities
        :::
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Error handling">
        - Use specific exception types
        - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
        - Implement proper resource cleanup
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Dependencies">
        - Avoid adding hard dependencies
        - Keep optional dependencies minimal
        - Review third-party packages for security issues
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Test writing guidelines

In order to write effective tests, there's a few good practices to follow:

:::python
- Use natural language to describe the test in docstrings
- Use descriptive variable names
- Be exhaustive with assertions
:::
:::js
- Encapsulate the test in a `describe` block that describes the component being tested
- Use natural language to describe the test name
- Be exhaustive with assertions
- Only use snapshots for reasonably sized data objects
:::

    <Tab title="Unit tests">

        ```python
        def test_document_processor_handles_empty_input():

            processor = DocumentProcessor()

            result = processor.process([])

            assert result.success
            assert result.processed_count == 0
            assert len(result.errors) == 0
