title: Versioning
---



Each LangChain and LangGraph version number follows the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Breaking API updates that require code changes.
- **Minor**: New features and improvements that maintain backward compatibility.
- **Patch**: Bug fixes and minor improvements.

## Version numbering

LangChain and LangGraph follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:

- `1.0.0`: First stable release with production-ready APIs
- `1.1.0`: New features added in a backward-compatible manner
- `1.0.1`: Backward-compatible bug fixes

## API stability

We communicate the stability of our APIs as follows:

### Stable APIs

All APIs without special prefixes are considered stable and ready for production use. We maintain backward compatibility for stable features and only introduce breaking changes in major releases.

### Beta APIs

APIs marked as `beta` are feature-complete but may undergo minor changes based on user feedback. They are safe for production use but may require small adjustments in future releases.

### Alpha APIs

APIs marked as `alpha` are experimental and subject to significant changes. Use these with caution in production environments.

### Deprecated APIs

APIs marked as `deprecated` will be removed in future major releases. When possible, we specify the intended version of removal. To handle deprecations:

1. Switch to the recommended alternative API
2. Follow the migration guide (released alongside major releases)
3. Use automated migration tools when available

### Internal APIs

Certain APIs are explicitly marked as "internal" in a couple of ways:

- Some documentation refers to internals and mentions them as such. If the documentation says that something is internal, it may change.
- Functions, methods, and other objects prefixed by a leading underscore (**`_`**). This is the standard Python convention of indicating that something is private; if any method starts with a single **`_`**, it's an internal API.
    - **Exception:** Certain methods are prefixed with `_` , but do not contain an implementation. These methods are *meant* to be overridden by sub-classes that provide the implementation. Such methods are generally part of the **Public API** of LangChain.

## Release cycles

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Major releases">
        Major releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) may include:

        - Breaking API changes
        - Removal of deprecated features
        - Significant architectural improvements

        We provide:

        - Detailed migration guides
        - Automated migration tools when possible
        - Extended support period for the previous major version
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Minor releases">
        Minor releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) include:

        - New features and capabilities
        - Performance improvements
        - New optional parameters
        - Backward-compatible enhancements
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Patch releases">
        Patch releases (e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) include:

        - Bug fixes
        - Security updates
        - Documentation improvements
        - Performance optimizations without API changes
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Version support policy

- **Latest major version**: Full support with active development (ACTIVE status)
- **Previous major version**: Security updates and critical bug fixes for 12 months after the next major release (MAINTENANCE status)
- **Older versions**: Community support only

### Long-term support (LTS) releases

Both LangChain and LangGraph 1.0 are designated as LTS releases:
- Version 1.0 will remain in ACTIVE status until version 2.0 is released
- After version 2.0 is released, version 1.0 will enter MAINTENANCE mode for at least 1 year
- LTS releases follow semantic versioning (semver), allowing safe upgrades between minor versions
- Legacy versions (LangChain 0.3 and LangGraph 0.4) are in MAINTENANCE mode until December 2026

For detailed information about release status and support timelines, see the [Release policy](/oss/release-policy).

## Pre-release versions

We occasionally release alpha and beta versions for early testing:

- **Alpha** (e.g., `1.0.0a1`): Early preview, significant changes expected
- **Beta** (e.g., `1.0.0b1`): Feature-complete, minor changes possible
- **Release Candidate** (e.g., `1.0.0rc1`): Final testing before stable release
