# How to construct knowledge graphs

In this guide we'll go over the basic ways of constructing a knowledge graph based on unstructured text. The constructured graph can then be used as knowledge base in a [RAG](/oss/concepts/rag/) application.

## ⚠️ Security note ⚠️

Constructing knowledge graphs requires executing write access to the database. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that you verify and validate data before importing it. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).


## Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of constructing a knowledge graph from text are:

1. **Extracting structured information from text**: Model is used to extract structured graph information from text.
2. **Storing into graph database**: Storing the extracted structured graph information into a graph database enables downstream RAG applications

## Setup

First, get required packages and set environment variables.
In this example, we will be using Neo4j graph database.


```python
%pip install --upgrade --quiet  langchain langchain-neo4j langchain-openai langchain-experimental neo4j
```
```output
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.0 -> 24.3.1
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```
We default to OpenAI models in this guide.


```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()

# Uncomment the below to use LangSmith. Not required.
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
# os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```
```output
 ········
```
Next, we need to define Neo4j credentials and connection.
Follow [these installation steps](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) to set up a Neo4j database.


```python
import os

from langchain_neo4j import Neo4jGraph

os.environ["NEO4J_URI"] = "bolt://localhost:7687"
os.environ["NEO4J_USERNAME"] = "neo4j"
os.environ["NEO4J_PASSWORD"] = "password"

graph = Neo4jGraph(refresh_schema=False)
```

## LLM Graph Transformer

Extracting graph data from text enables the transformation of unstructured information into structured formats, facilitating deeper insights and more efficient navigation through complex relationships and patterns. The `LLMGraphTransformer` converts text documents into structured graph documents by leveraging a LLM to parse and categorize entities and their relationships. The selection of the LLM model significantly influences the output by determining the accuracy and nuance of the extracted graph data.



```python
import os

from langchain_experimental.graph_transformers import LLMGraphTransformer
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-4-turbo")

llm_transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(llm=llm)
```

Now we can pass in example text and examine the results.


```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

text = """
Marie Curie, born in 1867, was a Polish and naturalised-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.
She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.
Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes.
She was, in 1906, the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.
"""
documents = [Document(page_content=text)]
graph_documents = await llm_transformer.aconvert_to_graph_documents(documents)
print(f"Nodes:{graph_documents[0].nodes}")
print(f"Relationships:{graph_documents[0].relationships}")
```
```output
Nodes:[Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={})]
Relationships:[Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), type='MARRIED', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={}), type='PROFESSOR', properties={})]
```
Examine the following image to better grasp the structure of the generated knowledge graph.

Note that the graph construction process is non-deterministic since we are using LLM. Therefore, you might get slightly different results on each execution.

Additionally, you have the flexibility to define specific types of nodes and relationships for extraction according to your requirements.


```python
llm_transformer_filtered = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=llm,
    allowed_nodes=["Person", "Country", "Organization"],
    allowed_relationships=["NATIONALITY", "LOCATED_IN", "WORKED_AT", "SPOUSE"],
)
graph_documents_filtered = await llm_transformer_filtered.aconvert_to_graph_documents(
    documents
)
print(f"Nodes:{graph_documents_filtered[0].nodes}")
print(f"Relationships:{graph_documents_filtered[0].relationships}")
```
```output
Nodes:[Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={})]
Relationships:[Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), type='SPOUSE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={}), type='WORKED_AT', properties={})]
```
To define the graph schema more precisely, consider using a three-tuple approach for relationships. In this approach, each tuple consists of three elements: the source node, the relationship type, and the target node.


```python
allowed_relationships = [
    ("Person", "SPOUSE", "Person"),
    ("Person", "NATIONALITY", "Country"),
    ("Person", "WORKED_AT", "Organization"),
]

llm_transformer_tuple = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=llm,
    allowed_nodes=["Person", "Country", "Organization"],
    allowed_relationships=allowed_relationships,
)
graph_documents_filtered = await llm_transformer_tuple.aconvert_to_graph_documents(
    documents
)
print(f"Nodes:{graph_documents_filtered[0].nodes}")
print(f"Relationships:{graph_documents_filtered[0].relationships}")
```
```output
Nodes:[Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={})]
Relationships:[Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), type='SPOUSE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={}), type='WORKED_AT', properties={})]
```
For a better understanding of the generated graph, we can again visualize it.

![graph_construction2.png](../../static/img/graph_construction2.png)

The `node_properties` parameter enables the extraction of node properties, allowing the creation of a more detailed graph.
When set to `True`, LLM autonomously identifies and extracts relevant node properties.
Conversely, if `node_properties` is defined as a list of strings, the LLM selectively retrieves only the specified properties from the text.


```python
llm_transformer_props = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=llm,
    allowed_nodes=["Person", "Country", "Organization"],
    allowed_relationships=["NATIONALITY", "LOCATED_IN", "WORKED_AT", "SPOUSE"],
    node_properties=["born_year"],
)
graph_documents_props = await llm_transformer_props.aconvert_to_graph_documents(
    documents
)
print(f"Nodes:{graph_documents_props[0].nodes}")
print(f"Relationships:{graph_documents_props[0].relationships}")
```
```output
Nodes:[Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={'born_year': '1867'}), Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={}), Node(id='Poland', type='Country', properties={}), Node(id='France', type='Country', properties={})]
Relationships:[Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Poland', type='Country', properties={}), type='NATIONALITY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='France', type='Country', properties={}), type='NATIONALITY', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='Pierre Curie', type='Person', properties={}), type='SPOUSE', properties={}), Relationship(source=Node(id='Marie Curie', type='Person', properties={}), target=Node(id='University Of Paris', type='Organization', properties={}), type='WORKED_AT', properties={})]
```
## Storing to graph database

The generated graph documents can be stored to a graph database using the `add_graph_documents` method.


```python
graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents_props)
```

Most graph databases support indexes to optimize data import and retrieval. Since we might not know all the node labels in advance, we can handle this by adding a secondary base label to each node using the `baseEntityLabel` parameter.


```python
graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents, baseEntityLabel=True)
```

Results will look like:

![graph_construction3.png](../../static/img/graph_construction3.png)

The final option is to also import the source documents for the extracted nodes and relationships. This approach lets us track which documents each entity appeared in.


```python
graph.add_graph_documents(graph_documents, include_source=True)
```

Graph will have the following structure:

![graph_construction4.png](../../static/img/graph_construction4.png)

In this visualization, the source document is highlighted in blue, with all entities extracted from it connected by `MENTIONS` relationships.


```python

```
