# How to use example selectors

If you have a large number of examples, you may need to select which ones to include in the prompt. The [Example Selector](/oss/concepts/example_selectors/) is the class responsible for doing so.

The base interface is defined as below:

```python
class BaseExampleSelector(ABC):
    """Interface for selecting examples to include in prompts."""

    @abstractmethod
    def select_examples(self, input_variables: Dict[str, str]) -> List[dict]:
        """Select which examples to use based on the inputs."""
        
    @abstractmethod
    def add_example(self, example: Dict[str, str]) -> Any:
        """Add new example to store."""
```

The only method it needs to define is a ``select_examples`` method. This takes in the input variables and then returns a list of examples. It is up to each specific implementation as to how those examples are selected.

LangChain has a few different types of example selectors. For an overview of all these types, see the [below table](#example-selector-types).

In this guide, we will walk through creating a custom example selector.

## Examples

In order to use an example selector, we need to create a list of examples. These should generally be example inputs and outputs. For this demo purpose, let's imagine we are selecting examples of how to translate English to Italian.


```python
examples = [
    {"input": "hi", "output": "ciao"},
    {"input": "bye", "output": "arrivederci"},
    {"input": "soccer", "output": "calcio"},
]
```

## Custom Example Selector

Let's write an example selector that chooses what example to pick based on the length of the word.


```python
from langchain_core.example_selectors.base import BaseExampleSelector


class CustomExampleSelector(BaseExampleSelector):
    def __init__(self, examples):
        self.examples = examples

    def add_example(self, example):
        self.examples.append(example)

    def select_examples(self, input_variables):
        # This assumes knowledge that part of the input will be a 'text' key
        new_word = input_variables["input"]
        new_word_length = len(new_word)

        # Initialize variables to store the best match and its length difference
        best_match = None
        smallest_diff = float("inf")

        # Iterate through each example
        for example in self.examples:
            # Calculate the length difference with the first word of the example
            current_diff = abs(len(example["input"]) - new_word_length)

            # Update the best match if the current one is closer in length
            if current_diff < smallest_diff:
                smallest_diff = current_diff
                best_match = example

        return [best_match]
```


```python
example_selector = CustomExampleSelector(examples)
```


```python
example_selector.select_examples({"input": "okay"})
```



```output
[{'input': 'bye', 'output': 'arrivederci'}]
```



```python
example_selector.add_example({"input": "hand", "output": "mano"})
```


```python
example_selector.select_examples({"input": "okay"})
```



```output
[{'input': 'hand', 'output': 'mano'}]
```


## Use in a Prompt

We can now use this example selector in a prompt


```python
from langchain_core.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate

example_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("Input: {input} -> Output: {output}")
```


```python
prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    example_selector=example_selector,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    suffix="Input: {input} -> Output:",
    prefix="Translate the following words from English to Italian:",
    input_variables=["input"],
)

print(prompt.format(input="word"))
```
```output
Translate the following words from English to Italian:

Input: hand -> Output: mano

Input: word -> Output:
```
## Example Selector Types

| Name       | Description                                                                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Similarity | Uses semantic similarity between inputs and examples to decide which examples to choose.    |
| MMR        | Uses Max Marginal Relevance between inputs and examples to decide which examples to choose. |
| Length     | Selects examples based on how many can fit within a certain length                          |
| Ngram      | Uses ngram overlap between inputs and examples to decide which examples to choose.          |


```python
