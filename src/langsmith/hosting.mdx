This section covers how to host and manage **LangSmith**: the infrastructure, services, and datastores that power your observability, evaluation, and agent deployment capabilities.

<Callout icon="building" color="#2563EB" iconType="regular">
**Start here if you're setting up or maintaining LangSmith infrastructure.** Looking to deploy your applications? See the [Deployment section](/langsmith/deployments).
</Callout>

## Choose your hosting option

You'll deploy LangSmith in one of three modes:
- [**Cloud**](/langsmith/cloud): fully managed by LangChain
- [**Hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid): LangChain manages the <Tooltip tip="The LangSmith UI and APIs for managing deployments.">control plane</Tooltip>; you host the <Tooltip tip="The runtime environment where your LangGraph Servers and agents execute.">data plane</Tooltip>
- [**Self-hosted**](/langsmith/self-hosted): you manage the full stack within your infrastructure
