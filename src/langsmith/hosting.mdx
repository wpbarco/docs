This section covers how to host and manage **LangSmith**: the control plane, data plane, and backing services that power agent deployments and observability.

You’ll learn how to deploy LangSmith in one of three modes:
- [**Cloud**](/langsmith/cloud): fully managed by LangChain
- [**Hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid): LangChain manages the control plane; you host the data plane
- [**Self-hosted**](/langsmith/self-hosted): you manage the full stack within your infrastructure
