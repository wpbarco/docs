To deploy on LangSmith, an application must consist of one or more graphs, a configuration file (`langgraph.json`), a file that specifies dependencies, and an optional `.env` file that specifies environment variables.

This page explains how a LangSmith application is organized and how to provide the configuration details required for deployment.

## Key Concepts

To deploy using LangSmith, provide the following information:

1. A [configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) (`langgraph.json`) that specifies the dependencies, graphs, and environment variables to use for the application.
1. The [graphs](#graphs) that implement the logic of the application.
1. A file that specifies [dependencies](#dependencies) required to run the application.
1. [Environment variables](#environment-variables) that are required for the application to run.

## File structure

The following are examples of directory structures for Python and JavaScript applications:

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python (requirements.txt)">
    ```plaintext

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JS (package.json)">

    │   ├── utils # optional utilities for your graph
    │   │   ├── tools.ts # tools for your graph

    ├── package.json # package dependencies
    ├── .env # environment variables
    └── langgraph.json # configuration file for LangGraph
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
The directory structure of an application can vary depending on the programming language and the package manager used.

## Configuration file

The `langgraph.json` file is a JSON file that specifies the dependencies, graphs, environment variables, and other settings required to deploy an application.

For details on all supported keys in the JSON file, refer to the [LangGraph configuration file reference](/langsmith/cli#configuration-file).

<Tip>
The [LangGraph CLI](/langsmith/cli) defaults to using the configuration file `langgraph.json` in the current directory.

### Examples

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Python">
    * The dependencies involve a custom local package and the `langchain_openai` package.
    * A single graph will be loaded from the file `./your_package/your_file.py` with the variable `variable`.
    * The environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file.

    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": [
            "langchain_openai",
            "./your_package"
        ],
        "graphs": {
            "my_agent": "./your_package/your_file.py:agent"
        },
        "env": "./.env"
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="JavaScript">
    * The dependencies will be loaded from a dependency file in the local directory (e.g., `package.json`).
    * A single graph will be loaded from the file `./your_package/your_file.js` with the function `agent`.
    * The environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set inline.

    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": [
            "."
        ],
        "graphs": {
            "my_agent": "./your_package/your_file.js:agent"
        },
        "env": {
            "OPENAI_API_KEY": "secret-key"
        }
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Dependencies

An application may depend on other Python packages or JavaScript libraries (depending on the programming language in which the application is written).

You will generally need to specify the following information for dependencies to be set up correctly:

1. A file in the directory that specifies the dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `package.json`).
2. A `dependencies` key in the [configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) that specifies the dependencies required to run the application.
3. Any additional binaries or system libraries can be specified using `dockerfile_lines` key in the [LangGraph configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts).

## Graphs

Use the `graphs` key in the [configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts) to specify which graphs will be available in the deployed application.

You can specify one or more graphs in the configuration file. Each graph is identified by a unique name and a path to either (1) a compiled graph or (2) a function that defines a graph.

## Environment variables

If you're working with a deployed LangGraph application [locally](/langsmith/local-server), you can configure environment variables in the `env` key of the [configuration file](#configuration-file-concepts).

For a production deployment, you will typically want to configure the environment variables in the deployment environment.
