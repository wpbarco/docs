This guide shows you how to enable **deployment management** on your self-hosted LangSmith instance. This adds a [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane) and [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane) that let you deploy, scale, and manage agents and applications directly through the LangSmith UI.

<Info>**Important**<br></br> Self-hosting LangSmith with deployment requires an [Enterprise](https://langchain.com/pricing) plan. </Info>

<Note>
**This setup page is for adding [deployment](/langsmith/deployments) capabilities to an existing LangSmith instance.**

Review the [self-hosted options](/langsmith/self-hosted) to understand:
- [LangSmith (observability)](/langsmith/self-hosted#langsmith): What you should install first.
- [LangSmith with deployment](/langsmith/self-hosted#langsmith-with-deployment): What this guide enables.
- [Standalone Server](/langsmith/self-hosted#standalone-server): Lightweight alternative without the UI.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide builds on top of the [Kubernetes installation guide](/langsmith/kubernetes). **You must complete that guide first** before continuing. This page covers the additional setup steps required to enable deployment functionality:
- Installing the LangGraph operator
- Configuring your ingress
- Connecting to the control plane

## Prerequisites

1. You are using Kubernetes.
2. You have an instance of [self-hosted LangSmith](/langsmith/kubernetes) running.
3. `KEDA` is installed on your cluster.
```bash
  helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
  helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda --create-namespace
```
6. Ingress Configuration
    1. You must set up an ingress, gateway, or use Istio for your LangSmith instance. All agents will be deployed as Kubernetes services behind this ingress. Use this guide to [set up an ingress](/langsmith/self-host-ingress) for your instance.
7. You must have slack space in your cluster for multiple deployments. `Cluster-Autoscaler` is recommended to automatically provision new nodes.
8. A valid Dynamic PV provisioner or PVs available on your cluster. You can verify this by running:
```bash
  kubectl get storageclass
```
9. Egress to `https://beacon.langchain.com` from your network. This is required for license verification and usage reporting if not running in air-gapped mode. See the [Egress documentation](/langsmith/self-host-egress) for more details.

## Setup

1. As part of configuring your self-hosted LangSmith instance, you enable the `deployment` option. This will provision a few key resources.
    1. `listener`: This is a service that listens to the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane) for changes to your deployments and creates/updates downstream CRDs.
    2. `LangGraphPlatform CRD`: A CRD for LangSmith Deployment. This contains the spec for managing an instance of a LangSmith deployment.
    3. `operator`: This operator handles changes to your LangSmith CRDs.
    4. `host-backend`: This is the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane).

<Note>
As of v0.12.0, the `langgraphPlatform` option is deprecated. Use `config.deployment` for any version after v0.12.0.
</Note>

2. Two additional images will be used by the chart. Use the images that are specified in the latest release.
```bash
  hostBackendImage:
    repository: "docker.io/langchain/hosted-langserve-backend"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  operatorImage:
    repository: "docker.io/langchain/langgraph-operator"
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```
3. In your config file for langsmith (usually `langsmith_config.yaml`), enable the `deployment` option. Note that you must also have a valid ingress setup:
```bash
  config:
    deployment:
      enabled: true
    # As of v0.12.0, this section is deprecated. Use config.deployment for any version after v0.12.0.
    langgraphPlatform:
      enabled: true
      langgraphPlatformLicenseKey: "YOUR_LANGGRAPH_PLATFORM_LICENSE_KEY"
```
4. In your `values.yaml` file, configure the `hostBackendImage` and `operatorImage` options (if you need to mirror images)
5. You can also configure base templates for your agents by overriding the base templates [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/blob/main/charts/langsmith/values.yaml#L898).

    Your self-hosted infrastructure is now ready to create deployments.

## Next steps

Once your infrastructure is set up, you're ready to deploy applications. See the deployment guides in the [Deployment tab](/langsmith/deployments) for instructions on building and deploying your applications.
