<Info>
**Important**
The Hybrid deployment option requires an [Enterprise](https://langchain.com/pricing) plan.
</Info>

The [**hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid) model lets you run the [data plane](/langsmith/data-plane)—your LangGraph Server deployments and agent workloads—in your own cloud, while LangChain hosts and manages the [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane) (the LangSmith UI and orchestration). This setup gives you the flexibility of self-hosting your runtime environments with the convenience of a managed LangSmith instance.

The following steps describe how to connect your self-hosted data plane to the managed LangSmith control plane.

## Kubernetes

### Prerequisites

1. `KEDA` is installed on your cluster.
    ```bash
      helm repo add kedacore https://kedacore.github.io/charts
      helm install keda kedacore/keda --namespace keda --create-namespace
    ```
2. A valid `Ingress` controller is installed on your cluster. For more information about configuring ingress for your deployment, refer to [Create an ingress for installations](/langsmith/self-host-ingress).
3. You have slack space in your cluster for multiple deployments. `Cluster-Autoscaler` is recommended to automatically provision new nodes.
4. You will need to enable egress to two control plane URLs. The listener polls these endpoints for deployments:
    - https://api.host.langchain.com
    - https://api.smith.langchain.com

### Setup

1. Provide your LangSmith organization ID to us. Your LangSmith organization will be configured to deploy the data plane in your cloud.
2. Create a listener from the LangSmith UI. The `Listener` data model is configured for the actual ["listener" application](/langsmith/data-plane#”listener”-application).
    1. In the left-hand navigation, select `Deployments` > `Listeners`.
    2. In the top-right of the page, select `+ Create Listener`.
    3. Enter a unique `Compute ID` for the listener. The `Compute ID` is a user-defined identifier that should be unique across all listeners in the current LangSmith workspace. The `Compute ID` is displayed to end users when they are creating a new deployment. Ensure that the `Compute ID` provides context to the end user about where their LangGraph Server deployments will be deployed to. For example, a `Compute ID` can be set to `k8s-cluster-name-dev-01`. In this example, the name of the Kubernetes cluster is `k8s-cluster-name`, `dev` denotes that the cluster is reserved for "development" workloads, and `01` is a numerical suffix to reduce naming collisions.
    4. Enter one or more Kubernetes namespaces. Later, the "listener" application will be configured to deploy to each of these namespaces.
    5. In the top-right on the page, select `Submit`.
    6. After the listener is created, copy the listener ID. You will use it later when installing the actual "listener" application in the Kubernetes cluster (step 5).
    <Info>
    **Important**
    Creating a listener from the LangSmith UI does not install the "listener" application in the Kubernetes cluster.
    </Info>
3. A [Helm chart](https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm/tree/main/charts/langgraph-dataplane) is provided to install the necesssary components in your Kubernetes cluster.
    - `langgraph-listener`: This is a service that listens to LangChain's [control plane](/langsmith/control-plane) for changes to your deployments and creates/updates downstream CRDs. This is the ["listener" application](/langsmith/data-plane#”listener”-application).
    - `LangGraphPlatform CRD`: A CRD for LangSmith Deployment. This contains the spec for managing an instance of a LangSmith Deployment.
    - `langgraph-platform-operator`: This operator handles changes to your LangSmith CRDs.
4. Configure your `langgraph-dataplane-values.yaml` file.
    ```bash
      config:
        langsmithApiKey: "" # API Key of your Workspace
        langsmithWorkspaceId: "" # Workspace ID
        hostBackendUrl: "https://api.host.langchain.com" # Only override this if on EU
        smithBackendUrl: "https://api.smith.langchain.com" # Only override this if on EU
        langgraphListenerId: "" # Listener ID from Step 2f
        watchNamespaces: "" # comma-separated list of Kubernetes namespaces that the listener and operator will deploy to
        enableLGPDeploymentHealthCheck: true # enable/disable health check step for deployments

      ingress:
        hostname: "" # specify a hostname that will be configured for all deployments

      operator:
        enabled: true # set this to `false` if the operator is already deployed in the current Kubernetes namespace
        createCRDs: true # set this to `false` if the CRD has been previously installed in the current Kubernetes cluster
    ```
    - `config.langsmithApiKey`: The `langgraph-listener` deployment authenticates with LangChain's LangGraph control plane API with the `langsmithApiKey`.
    - `config.langsmithWorkspaceId`: The `langgraph-listener` deployment is coupled to LangGraph Server deployments in the LangSmith workspace. In other words, the `langgraph-listener` deployment can only manage LangGraph Server deployments in the specified LangSmith workspace ID.
    - `config.langgraphListenerId`: In addition to being coupled with a LangSmith workspace, the `langgraph-listener` deployment is also coupled to a listener. When a new LangGraph Server deployment is created, it is automatically coupled to a `langgraphListenerId`. Specifying `langgraphListenerId` ensures that the `langgraph-listener` deployment can only manage LangGraph Server deployments that are coupled to `langgraphListenerId`.
    - `config.watchNamespaces`: A comma-separated list of Kubernetes namespaces that the `langgraph-listener` deployment will deploy to. This list should match the list of namespaces specified in step 2d.
    - `config.enableLGPDeploymentHealthCheck`: To disable the LangGraph Server health check, set this to `false`.
    - `ingress.hostname`: As part of the deployment workflow, the `langgraph-listener` deployment attempts to call the LangGraph Server health check endpoint (`GET /ok`) to verify that the application has started up correctly. A typical setup involves creating a shared DNS record or domain for LangGraph Server deployments. This is not managed by LangSmith. Once created, set `ingress.hostname` to the domain, which will be used to complete the health check.
    - `operator.enabled`: There can only be 1 instance of the `langgraph-platform-operator` deployed in a Kubernetes namespace. Set this to `false` if there is already an instance of `langgraph-platform-operator` deployed in the current Kubernetes namespace.
    - `operator.createCRDs`: Set this value to `false` if the Kubernetes cluster already has the `LangGraphPlatform CRD` installed. During installation, an error will occur if the CRD is already installed. This situation may occur if multiple listeners are deployed on the same Kubernetes cluster.
5. Deploy `langgraph-dataplane` Helm chart.
    ```bash
      helm repo add langchain https://github.com/langchain-ai/helm
      helm repo update
      helm upgrade -i langgraph-dataplane langchain/langgraph-dataplane --values langgraph-dataplane-values.yaml --wait --debug
    ```
6. If successful, you will see three services start up in your namespace.
    ```bash
      NAME                                            READY   STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE
      langgraph-dataplane-listener-6dd4749445-zjmr4   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          26s
      langgraph-dataplane-operator-6b88879f9b-t76gk   1/1     Running             0          26s
      langgraph-dataplane-redis-0                     1/1     Running             0          25s
    ```

    Your hybrid infrastructure is now ready to create deployments.

## Next steps

Once your infrastructure is set up, you're ready to deploy applications. See the deployment guides in the [Deployment tab](/langsmith/deployments) for instructions on building and deploying your applications.
