If you're ready to deploy your app to Cloud, follow the [Cloud deployment quickstart](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) or the [full setup guide](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud). This page explains the Cloud hosting model for reference.
</Callout>

The **Cloud** option is a fully managed hosting model where LangChain hosts and operates all LangSmith infrastructure and services:

- **Fully managed infrastructure**: LangChain handles all infrastructure, updates, scaling, and maintenance.
- **Deploy from GitHub**: Connect your repositories and deploy with a few clicks.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Build process is handled automatically by the platform.
- **LangSmith UI**: Full access to [observability](/langsmith/observability), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), [deployment management](/langsmith/deployments), and [Studio](/langsmith/studio).

|                   | **Who manages it** | **Where it runs** |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **LangSmith platform (UI, APIs, datastores)** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **Your LangGraph Servers** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **CI/CD for your apps** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |

![Cloud deployment: LangChain hosts and manages all components including the UI, APIs, and your LangGraph Servers.](/langsmith/images/langgraph-cloud-architecture.png)

## Get started

To deploy your first application to Cloud, follow the [Cloud deployment quickstart](/langsmith/deployment-quickstart) or refer to the [comprehensive setup guide](/langsmith/deploy-to-cloud).

## Cloud architecture and scalability

<Note>
This section is only relevant for the cloud-managed LangSmith services available at [https://smith.langchain.com](https://smith.langchain.com) and [https://eu.smith.langchain.com](https://eu.smith.langchain.com).

For information on the self-hosted LangSmith solution, please refer to the [self-hosted documentation](/langsmith/self-hosted).
</Note>

LangSmith is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is designed to be highly scalable. Many customers run production workloads on LangSmith for LLM application observability, evaluation, and agent deployment

### Architecture

The US-based LangSmith service is deployed in the `us-central1` (Iowa) region of GCP.

<Note>
The [EU-based LangSmith service](https://eu.smith.langchain.com) is now available (as of mid-July 2024) and is deployed in the `europe-west4` (Netherlands) region of GCP. If you are interested in an enterprise plan in this region, [contact our sales team](https://www.langchain.com/contact-sales).
</Note>

#### Regional storage

The resources and services in this table are stored in the location corresponding to the URL where sign-up occurred (either the US or EU). Cloud-managed LangSmith uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for authentication/authorization and [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/cloud) for data warehouse.

See the [Regions FAQ](/langsmith/regions-faq) for more information.

#### Region-independent storage

Data listed here is stored exclusively in the US:

* Payment and billing information with Stripe and Metronome

#### GCP services

LangSmith is composed of the following services, all deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

* LangSmith Frontend: serves the LangSmith UI.
* LangSmith Backend: serves the LangSmith API.
* LangSmith Platform Backend: handles authentication and other high-volume tasks. (Internal service)
* LangSmith Playground: handles forwarding requests to various LLM providers for the Playground feature.
* LangSmith Queue: handles processing of asynchronous tasks. (Internal service)

LangSmith uses the following GCP storage services:

* Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for runs inputs and outputs.
* Google Cloud SQL PostgreSQL for transactional workloads.
* Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis for queuing and caching.
* Clickhouse Cloud on GCP for trace ingestion and analytics. Our services connect to Clickhouse Cloud, which is hosted in the same GCP region, via a private endpoint.

Some additional GCP services we use include:

* Google Cloud Load Balancer for routing traffic to the LangSmith services.
* Google Cloud CDN for caching static assets.
* Google Cloud Armor for security and rate limits. For more information on rate limits we enforce, please refer to [this guide](/langsmith/administration-overview#rate-limits).

### Allowlisting IP addresses

#### Egress from LangChain SaaS
All traffic leaving LangSmith services will be routed through a NAT gateway. All traffic will appear to originate from the following IP addresses:

| US             | EU             |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 34.59.65.97    | 34.13.192.67   |
| 34.67.51.221   | 34.147.105.64  |
| 34.46.212.37   | 34.90.22.166   |
| 34.132.150.88  | 34.147.36.213  |
| 35.188.222.201 | 34.32.137.113  |
| 34.58.194.127  | 34.91.238.184  |
| 34.59.97.173   | 35.204.101.241 |
| 104.198.162.55 | 35.204.48.32   |

It may be helpful to allowlist these IP addresses if connecting to your own AzureOpenAI service or other endpoints that may be required by the Playground or Online Evaluation.

#### Ingress into LangChain SaaS
The langchain endpoints map to the following static IP addresses:

| US             | EU             |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 34.8.121.39    | 34.95.92.214   |
| 34.107.251.234 | 34.13.73.122   |

You may need to allowlist these to enable traffic from your private network to LangSmith SaaS endpoints (`api.smith.langchain.com`, `smith.langchain.com`, `beacon.langchain.com`, `eu.api.smith.langchain.com`, `eu.smith.langchain.com`, `eu.beacon.langchain.com`).
