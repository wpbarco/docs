The **Cloud** option is a fully managed hosting model where LangChain hosts and operates all LangSmith infrastructure and services:

- **Fully managed infrastructure**: LangChain handles all infrastructure, updates, scaling, and maintenance.
- **Deploy from GitHub**: Connect your repositories and deploy with a few clicks.
- **Automated CI/CD**: Build process is handled automatically by the platform.
- **LangSmith UI**: Full access to [observability](/langsmith/observability), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), [deployment management](/langsmith/deployments), and [Studio](/langsmith/studio).

|                   | **Who manages it** | **Where it runs** |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **LangSmith platform (UI, APIs, datastores)** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **Your LangGraph Servers** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
| **CI/CD for your apps** | LangChain | LangChain's cloud |
