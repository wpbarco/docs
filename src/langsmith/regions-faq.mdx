#### *Are there any functional differences between US and EU cloud-managed LangSmith?*

There may be a small delay between launches to each region depending on the feature. Besides that, they are functionally equivalent - all features supported in the US are supported in the EU and vice versa.

#### *What data will be stored in my selected region?*
