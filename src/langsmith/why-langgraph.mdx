**LangSmith** builds on the open-source [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) framework for developing stateful, multi-agent applications.
LangGraph provides the core abstractions and execution model, while LangSmith adds managed infrastructure, observability, deployment options, assistants, and concurrency controls â€” supporting the full lifecycle from development to production.

<Callout icon="cubes" color="#4F46E5" iconType="regular">
LangSmith is framework-agnostic: you can deploy agents built with LangGraph or [other frameworks](/langsmith/autogen-integration). To get started with LangGraph itself, refer to the [LangGraph quickstart](/oss/langgraph/quickstart).
