LangGraph Platform is a runtime for deploying and managing long-running, stateful agent workflows in production. It provides APIs for execution, persistence, monitoring, and scaling of agent applications. Agents built with [LangGraph](/oss/langgraph/overview) or other frameworks can be hosted on the platform and exposed through managed endpoints.

Choose from cloud, hybrid, or self-hosted deployments based on your infrastructure requirements. For more details, refer to the [Deployment options](/langgraph-platform/deployment-options) page.
