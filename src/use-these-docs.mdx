title: Use docs programmatically
description: Connect LangChain documentation to your AI tools and workflows
---

We want to make our documentation as accessible as possible. We've included several ways for you to use these docs programmatically through AI assistants, code editors, and direct integrations, such as Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Quick access options

On any page in our documentation, you'll find a contextual menu dropdown in the top right corner:

<img
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/copy-page-light.png"
    alt="Copy page light mode"
/>

<img
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/copy-page-dark.png"
    alt="Copy page dark mode"
/>

This includes our `llms.txt`, MCP server connection, and other quick access options such as ChatGPT and Claude.

## Use our MCP server

Our documentation includes a built-in **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** that lets AI applications query the latest docs in real-time.

The LangChain docs MCP server is available at:

```txt
https://docs.langchain.com/mcp
```

Once connected, you can ask your AI assistant questions about LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith, and it will search our documentation to provide accurate, current answers.

### Connect with Claude Code

If you're using Claude Code, run this command in your terminal to add the server to your current project:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http docs-langchain https://docs.langchain.com/mcp
```

<Note>
    **Project (local) scoped**

    The command above adds the MCP server only to your current project/working directory. To add the MCP server globally and access it in all projects, add the user scope by adding `--scope user` to the command:

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport http docs-langchain --scope user https://docs.langchain.com/mcp
    ```
</Note>

### Connect with Claude Desktop

1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings > Connectors
3. Add our MCP server URL: `https://docs.langchain.com/mcp`

### Connect with Cursor or VS Code

Add the following to your MCP settings configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-langchain": {
      "url": "https://docs.langchain.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
